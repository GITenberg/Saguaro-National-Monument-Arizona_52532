<h2><span class="small">preface</span></h2>
<p>This book is a simple account of the natural history of Saguaro
National Monument. It is intended to help you understand the
relationships between land, climate, plants, wild animals, and man
in the environment of a hot desert. While it includes brief profiles
of many representative species, it is not intended to serve as a
guide to the monument. It does indicate where the several distinctive
natural communities exist, and when and where to look
for certain plants and animals. For identification purposes, you
will need field guides.</p>
<p>The present edition is my revision of the 1957 book by Natt
Dodge, then naturalist for the Southwest Region of the National
Park Service. The first five and the last two chapters are essentially
new; the central chapters on plants and animals remain largely as
written in the first edition.</p>
<p>The authors wish to thank former and present members of
the monument staff for their help and companionship, in both field
and office. We are particularly grateful to Chief Naturalist Harold
T. Coss, Jr., who devoted much time and effort to obtaining many
of the photographs and, with Park Biologist Warren F. Steenbergh,
gave the manuscript a thorough scrutiny. The cooperation and
hospitality of Superintendent Harold R. Jones have created the
best possible climate for work on the revised edition. National
Park Service geologist Robert H. Rose contributed in very great
measure to the geological content. Finally, our thanks go to the
many students of desert life on whose knowledge this book has
been built, and to monument visitors who ask questions&mdash;for their
concern gives hope for better relations between man and nature.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">the desert scene</span></h2>
<p>Scattered through the wide, lonely Sonoran Desert, isolated mountain
ranges raise jagged blue silhouettes against the sky. The high
ones wear a crown of dark pines and a speckled mantle of oaks.
Lapping against their feet is the desert sea, studded with the green
masts of giant saguaro cactuses rising above a motley crew of
tough, strange, often handsome subordinates.</p>
<p>On either side of the Santa Cruz Valley in southeastern Arizona,
Saguaro National Monument embraces two of these ranges, with
the desert lands at their feet. Although it was established primarily
to preserve impressive stands of saguaros, it gains wholeness
by including the mountains that shed the rocky soil on which the
saguaros grow. The monument is in two sections, some 30 miles
apart. The <i>Rincon Mountain Section</i>, east of Tucson, includes in
its 99 square miles a spectrum of plantlife ranging from saguaro
communities at the low elevations to a wet fir forest on the north
slope of 8,666-foot Mica Mountain. The 24-square-mile <i>Tucson
Mountain Section</i>, about 12 miles west of the city, has a denser
stand of saguaros, on the lower slopes of a wild jumble of volcanic
mountains dominated by 4,687-foot Wasson Peak.</p>
<p>Within the cactus forests and upon the mountain slopes, life
in myriad forms goes on in a delicate and continuous adjustment
to changing environments. Over millennia, mountains rise and
crumble, species evolve and fade from the scene. Over days and
weeks and years, populations of plants and animals rise and fall,
in response to thousands of interactions which we are only beginning
to understand. In the following pages, we will meet the
main characters in this natural drama (including some of the most
improbable in all of nature); we will investigate the environmental
stage upon which they perform; and we will try to understand
something of the play itself, including our own role in it.</p>

<br />and the monument</h2>
<p>Saguaro National Monument is at the northeastern edge of the
Sonoran Desert. Named for the state of Sonora, Mexico, in which
the greater part of it lies, this, one of four major deserts in
North America, is distinguished by differences in climate and
vegetation. The Great Basin Desert, mainly in Nevada and Utah
between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, has cold winters,
sparse precipitation distributed fairly evenly throughout the year,
and rather simple vegetation dominated by the low shrubs, sagebrush
and saltbrush. Immediately to the south, in southern
Nevada and southeastern California, is the Mohave Desert, with
cool winters during which most of the year&rsquo;s precipitation
comes, and with plant cover consisting mostly of shrubs such as
creosotebush. At higher elevations grows the Joshua-tree, a giant
yucca. The Chihuahuan Desert, with cool winters and summer
rainfall, covers the broad plateau of north-central Mexico, extending
into southern New Mexico and west Texas. Its vegetation
consists mostly of small cactuses, spiny shrubs, and succulent-leaved
plants such as yuccas.</p>
<p>Lying between the Mohave and Chihuahuan deserts, the Sonoran
Desert has both winter and summer rainfall, with spring and
autumn droughts. Its mild winters and bi-seasonal rainfall encourage
a vegetation far surpassing in lushness and variety that of
the other deserts. From west to east, the land rises and precipitation
increases. Yuma, in southwestern Arizona, lying at 141 feet
above sea level, gets about 3 inches a year. Tucson, in southeastern
Arizona, is at 2,400 feet elevation and averages 11 inches a
year. In the western part, where plains are extensive and mountain
ranges low and far apart, a very few small-leaved species such as
creosotebush dominate. Toward the east, mountain ranges become
more numerous, shedding material on which more kinds of plants,
particularly paloverde, mesquite, and cactuses, assume leading
roles in the vegetative cover. Both sections of the monument lie
within the eastern, wetter, more diversified part of the Sonoran
Desert known as the Arizona Upland. Organ Pipe Cactus National
Monument, to the southwest, is in an area transitional between
the Arizona upland and Colorado River lowland phases of
the Sonoran Desert.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>But even between the two sections of Saguaro National Monument
there are differences. There is the obvious fact that the
Tucson Mountains are much lower and smaller in mass than the
Rincons. And there is the not-so-obvious fact that the Tucson
Mountain Section extends to lower elevations (2,200 as opposed
to 2,700 feet). These conditions are reflected in the somewhat
warmer environment of the western section. This helps to explain
why certain Sonoran Desert plants and animals here reach their
northeastern limits; among them are ironwood, desert iguana,
desert horned lizard, western shovel-nosed snake, sidewinder,
desert kangaroo rat, and the Le Conte thrasher. The Rincon
Mountain Section, by virtue of its higher elevations, has plants
and animals&mdash;such as ponderosa pine, Steller&rsquo;s jay, and whitetail
deer&mdash;not found in the western section.</p>
<p>On the geologic time scale the Sonoran Desert, like all the
earth&rsquo;s present deserts, is a recent development. Some 50 million
years ago tropical forests grew here, as they did over most of
southern North America. As the Southwest gradually became
drier, new species adapted to the new conditions evolved; and the
general type of vegetation changed&mdash;with some retrogression during
wetter periods&mdash;from forest to savanna (grasslands with scattered
trees) to arid subtropical scrub (such as is now found in
southern Sonora State), and finally to the plant communities of
today&rsquo;s Sonoran Desert. The last stage has occurred only during
the past few million years.</p>
<p>The assemblage of species from which most of our present
desert and lower mountain plants were derived is known as the
Madro-Tertiary Flora, to denote its center (Sierra Madre in Mexico)
and time (Tertiary period&mdash;one million to 65 million years
ago) of early development. Reflecting these origins, a majority
of the species growing below 6,000 feet elevation in the monument
today are basically Mexican or Central or South American in their
distribution.</p>
<p>On the higher mountains of the Sonoran Desert, however, exist
species with an entirely different ancestry. Most of the plants of
the pine and fir forests of these high places, like the plants of the
Great Basin Desert, derive from the Arcto-Tertiary Flora, which
dominated the northern part of our continent during Tertiary times.
As climate changes, one or the other of these great plant assemblages
will benefit at the expense of the other. If cooler, wetter
periods return, as they did during the Pleistocene epoch, ponderosa
pines, now found above 6,000 feet, may again grow nearly
as low down as today&rsquo;s cactus forests. But if the present long-term
drying trend continues, the northern plants will eventually be
squeezed off their mountaintops.</p>
<p>Animals, to some extent, reflect the same dichotomy of origins
we have seen in the plants. Thus, on the mountaintops supporting
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
pine and fir forests, a northern contingent of animals predominates,
while on the lower slopes and desert the fauna has a Mexican
character. The canyons and oak-pine forests of middle elevations
in southeastern Arizona are particularly exciting, because in these
biological islands, isolated by surrounding desert, live many
&ldquo;Mexican&rdquo; species of animals found nowhere else in the United
States. Naturally, mountain ranges nearest the border&mdash;such as
the Huachucas and Chiricahuas&mdash;have the greatest numbers of
Mexican specialties; but the Rincons have their share too.</p>
<p>The wonderful diversity of plant and animal life in Saguaro
National Monument depends on a diversity of habitats. These in
turn owe their existence to a widely varying triumvirate of environmental
factors&mdash;climate, soil, and topography. To understand the
biological interplay that goes on here, we first must know something
of the environmental conditions that circumscribe it.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">climate:</span>
<br />the vital factor</h2>
<p>Climate is the chief arbiter of life on earth. Each plant and animal,
including man, has tolerance limits for heat and water below
or above which it dies. The Sonoran desert, with its low and
uncertain rainfall and high summer temperatures, thus presents
one of earth&rsquo;s most taxing environments. For most desert plants
and animals, the main problem presented by this climatic combination
is a scarcity of water. Why, we might ask, is this part of
the globe so dry?</p>
<p>Essentially, the dryness of the Sonoran and other southwestern
deserts results from their geographic situation. First, these lands
lie east of a persistent high-pressure cell over the eastern Pacific&mdash;part
of a belt of high-pressure cells which encircles the earth at
this latitude. High-pressure systems in the Northern Hemisphere
have descending, warming, dry air in their middles and along their
eastern sides. The air that flows eastward from the &ldquo;East Pacific
high&rdquo; thus contains little moisture, and dictates desert conditions
over much of the Southwest. Furthermore, the mountains that more
or less ring these deserts intercept much of the meager incoming
moisture, by forcing the air to rise and cool so that its moisture
condenses and falls to the ground.</p>
<p>But during two periods of the year, the desert does receive rain.
In winter, the East Pacific high shifts southward with the sun,
reducing its effects on the Southwest. Now the low pressure storm
systems, which at this season move eastward across the continent,
can sometimes dip far enough south to bring rain to the Sonoran
Desert. These rains are usually gentle, and cover large areas.
Their clouds may cover the sky for several days at a time.</p>
<p>By April, the East Pacific high has returned far enough northward
to resume its control of southwestern weather. Now the
fore-summer drought sets in, intensified by gradually rising temperatures.
Day after day the sun climbs higher in the sky, baking
the earth and testing the endurance of desert life. Then, sometime
in late June or early July, clouds begin forming in the afternoons
over the mountains; finally, one day they build up to great thunderheads.
The drought ends suddenly as rain pours down and lightning
cracks the sky. Down the canyons and along the desert
washes rages the water, brown with soil. In a short time, the storm
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
is over, and the water disappears into the ground. Just 1 mile
away, rain may not have fallen.</p>
<p>These intense, local summer rains, so different from the winter
ones, have a different origin as well. They are spawned by the
Atlantic&rsquo;s Bermuda high, which has shifted northwestward and sent
moist air from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico flowing off its
western edge toward the deserts. This air rises quickly when it
strikes hot, high mountains such as the Rincons, and its moisture
condenses to fall as rain.</p>
<p>Some time in September the rains of summer stop, as the Bermuda
High moves south again, removing its influence and returning
the East Pacific high to a position of dominance. The sun
and wind again wring moisture from the soil, but with diminishing
effect. The thermometer no longer reaches the 100&rsquo;s as it
did in June, July, and August. In November or December, the
winter rains begin. Water stays longer in the soil, because
temperatures now range between 30&deg; and 80&deg;. Life in the desert
begins a new cycle. This rainy period usually lasts into March.</p>
<p>On the mountain slopes, of course, the same seasonal patterns
of heat and precipitation occur, but they are tempered or enhanced
by elevation. With increasing elevation, temperatures decline and
precipitation increases. When July temperatures at headquarters
are averaging in the nineties, they will be in the sixties on top of the
Rincons. In the cactus forest at the foot of Tanque Verde Ridge
only about 10 to 12 inches of rain fall in a year, while Manning
Camp, at 8,000 feet, gets about 18 to 25 inches. These up-slope
gradients of temperature and precipitation, as we shall see, have
pronounced effects on plant and animal life.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">rocks:</span>
<br />foundation and soilmakers</h2>
<p>Soils are derived from the fragmentation and decomposition of
rocks. Combinations of soils and climate, varying from place to
place, create an almost infinite number of environments with differences
so subtle and small as to make it appropriate to refer
to them as microenvironments. Though these differences be minor,
they are often sufficient to create niches each of which becomes a
habitat for a particular group of plants and animals. Thus it is
that the saguaros and other desert vegetation in Saguaro National
Monument and vicinity are found in particular environmental or
ecological niches where just the right combinations of soils, moisture,
sunlight, temperature and other factors are present.</p>
<p>Since the rocks provide the foundation and the source of soils
that support the plant and animal life, it is helpful to understand
something about the origin and evolution of the rocks and the
landscape of which they are a part. Clues to this story are to be
found in the composition of the rocks and their relationships to
one another.</p>
<p>Rocks of the three major classes&mdash;igneous, metamorphic, and
sedimentary&mdash;are found within the monument. The igneous rocks
include granites and various kinds of lava flows, together with some
intrusive dikes and veins. The metamorphic rocks are represented
by gneiss and schist. Lastly, sedimentary rocks occur as limestone,
sandstone, and alluvial fill material. Each of these great classes
of rocks was formed in a different manner, and these differences
reveal the nature of the events which are a part of the geologic
history of the monument and surrounding area.</p>
<p>Catalina Gneiss (pronounced <span class="small">NICE</span>) is the predominant rock that
visitors see in the Rincon Mountains and the Tanque Verde Ridge;
exposures of granite and schist are also found. Gneiss is a coarse-grained
metamorphic rock resembling granite, having a banded
appearance, and consisting of alternating layers of different minerals
such as feldspar, quartz, mica, and hornblende. The banding
and texture reveal that the gneiss, now exposed by uplift and
erosion, was formed from parent rocks deep below the earth&rsquo;s
surface during the Precambrian Era more than a half billion years
ago. There the parent rocks, subjected to pressure and heat, melted,
flowed, and crystallized, before resolidification.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Though the gneiss of the Rincon Mountains is ancient, the uplift
that raised it to its present height is thought to have occurred
rather recently (within the past 24 million years), during the period
when most of the Sonoran Desert ranges apparently were formed.
In age, these mountains thus would fall somewhere between the
older Rockies and the younger Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>The schist, which underlies much of the Cactus Forest, where
it is exposed along washes, was probably formed during the
Cretaceous period more than 65 million years ago. Like the gneiss,
the schist is a metamorphic rock, having been formed by the transformation
of parent rocks at depth under great pressure and heat.
Due mainly to differences in the composition of the parent rock,
together with its mica content, the rock that resulted was platy and
cleavable (accounting for its classification as schist).</p>
<p>Granite, which forms Wasson and Amole peaks in the Tucson
Mountain Section, is an igneous rock that (like the metamorphic
gneiss and schist) originated at depths below the earth&rsquo;s surface.
The granite was formed by the solidification of molten rock material
that moved upward en masse from greater depths, rather than
by the alteration of ancestral rocks. Erosion of the uplifted land
mass has not only stripped away the overburden but has developed
valleys deeply incised into the granite itself.</p>
<p>Volcanic rocks in the form of rhyolite, andesite, and basalt flows
also are exposed, chiefly in the Tucson Mountain section of the
monument. These are all extrusive igneous rocks composed of
magma that solidified after reaching the earth&rsquo;s surface through
vents or fissures. There are differences in the lava flows, reflecting
differences in composition, temperature, and other conditions of
the magma from which they were formed. The rhyolite is lighter
in color than andesite, and it is somewhat richer in feldspar. Basalt,
on the other hand, is dark, is deficient in feldspar and quartz, and
contains relatively large amounts of the darker minerals such as
hornblende, pyroxene, and olivene. Lava flows of the rhyolite
and andesite variety occur in the Cactus Forest locality of the
Rincon Mountain Section. Cat Mountain Rhyolite is the name
given to a rhyolite flow of Tertiary age that forms the topmost
layer in much of the Tucson Mountain Section. A small exposure
of basalt is also found here.</p>
<p>Limestone, sandstone, and shale formations are also exposed at
various places within the monument. They are reliable indicators
of seas that covered the area during one or more times of the
geologic past. Comparisons with the limestone formations farther
to the south in the Colossal Cave region indicate that the limestone
in the monument was formed as far back as late in the
Paleozoic Era (345 million years or more ago). This age is suggested
by types of fossils, including fragments of crablike trilobites
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
and crinoid (sea lily) stems, found in limestones of the same age
near Colossal Cave.</p>
<p>The Recreation Redbeds of the Tucson Mountain Section is
one of the important sandstone members exposed in the monument.
Geologists believe that its deposition occurred early in the
Cretaceous Period more than 65 million years ago. Above the
Recreation Redbeds lies a formation consisting mainly of limestone
and commonly known as the Tucson Mountain &ldquo;Chaos&rdquo;&mdash;an
appropriate name, in view of the geologists&rsquo; meager knowledge
of it. Within the Chaos formation, believed to be lower to Middle
Tertiary in age, are limestone blocks of greater age than the rocks
within which they are entombed. No generally accepted explanations
have been advanced as to how these relationships developed.</p>
<p>The processes that destroy mountains continue concurrently
with those that build them. Temperature changes, weathering, and
downslope creep under the influence of gravity are among the
agents which destroy the rocks and eventually convert them into
soil. Though these processes work rapidly from a geological standpoint,
in terms of the average human life span, they progress at an
imperceptible rate. Violent thunderstorms and cloudbursts, however,
cause a massive, often spectacular movement of boulders,
gravel, sand, and silt by torrential streams.</p>
<p>In desert regions, most of the runoff from storms sinks into the
slopes, dropping its burden along the way. Big rocks are dropped
early as the carrying power of the water diminishes with the speed
of flow; smaller fragments travel farther. The finest material is
carried far out into the basins between mountain ranges, gradually
filling them. (The alluvial material in the Tucson Basin is
estimated to be 2,000 to 5,000 feet thick.) Thus desert mountains
tend to bury themselves in their own debris.</p>
<p>Alluvial fans (fan-shaped deposits built by rivers flowing from
mountains into lowlands) form at the mouths of canyons. Sometimes
the alluvial fans of adjacent canyons coalesce, forming the
long, sweeping slope known as a bajada (pronounced ba-<span class="small">HA</span>-da).
In other places the eroded bedrock extends outward from the
bases of desert mountains, forming &ldquo;pediments,&rdquo; which are usually
covered by a veneer of alluvial material. Pediments of this kind
stretch from the lower slopes of the Rincon Mountains. In the
Tucson Mountains the alluvial material deepens rapidly toward
the Avra Valley because the bedrock at the base of the mountain
dips steeply downward.</p>
<p>Serious gaps remain in the story of the origin and evolution of
the landscape in Saguaro National Monument. Moreover, it is
difficult to establish the exact sequence in which the various events
occurred. The composition, texture, and relationships of the rocks,
however, do reveal much about the nature of the events and the
processes that were involved.</p>

<p>The presence of the limestones and sandstones indicates that
that area was submerged below the water of ancient seas one or
more times in the geologic past. The gneiss, schist, and granite
bespeak deep-seated metamorphism and magmatic intrusion, which
gave these rocks the form, composition, and texture they possess
today. The lava flows are indicative of volcanic activity that was
a part of the extensive volcanism that occurred in this part of
southern Arizona. And, finally, the great alluvial fans and bajadas
suggest that these mountain ranges could bury themselves in their
own products of erosion unless the mountain-building processes
in future eons continue at a faster pace than the wearing-down
processes. This evidence enables us to perceive today&rsquo;s landscape
as but a transitional phase in the drama of change that will continue
for milleniums.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">plant and animal zones</span></h2>
<p>Mountains are biologically exciting because their elevation produces,
in a short vertical distance, the same climatic changes that
occur over long latitudinal distances. In Arizona, average temperatures
drop about 4&deg; with each 1,000-foot rise in elevation, and
precipitation increases about 4 to 5 inches. At sea level, you would
have to travel about 900 miles north to experience the climatic
change found in going from the lowest part of the monument
(2,200 feet) to the top of Mica Mountain (8,600 feet). Plant-and-animal
communities change along these climatic gradients.</p>
<p>In southern Arizona, the sequence of vegetation types begins
with desert scrub at the lowest elevations, and ranges through desert
grassland, oak woodland and chaparral, oak-pine woodland, ponderosa
pine forest, and Douglas-fir forest, to Engelmann spruce
forest on top of the highest mountains. In the national monument,
we have all these types except the last&mdash;although desert grassland
is poorly represented here because the steep slopes squeeze it into
a narrow altitudinal band; and Douglas-fir forest is restricted to
small areas in canyons and on north-facing slopes at high elevations.
A few drainageways (notably Chiminea Canyon, on the
south side of the monument) support patches of deciduous trees
classified as riparian woodland.</p>
<p>These vegetation zones should not be visualized as nice neat
bands on the mountainsides, however, for roughness of topography
and differing tolerances of plant species usually lead to gradual
changes from one zone to the next. Because of the greater exposure
to drying heat and sunlight, each belt occupies a higher range
of elevation on south-facing slopes than on north-facing ones.
And along draws, where conditions are wetter and cooler than on
ridges at the same elevations, the vegetation zones finger down to
lower elevations; on ridges the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Animals are less restricted than plants to particular vegetation
belts, but they, too, show a zonation with altitude. You must
look, for instance, in the paloverde-saguaro community (part of
the desert scrub type) for kangaroo rats and cactus wrens; in the
oak-pine woodland for Mexican jays; and in the ponderosa pine
forest for whitetail deer and tassel-eared squirrels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>In the Tucson Mountains, only the desert scrub type is well
represented, although the highest ridges support a suggestion of
desert grassland. A small patch of shrub live oaks, relicts of a
wetter period, huddles on the north side of Wasson Peak. Zonation
is poorly developed here because the mountains are low and
small in mass. (Studies have shown that mountains of smaller
mass tend to have warmer and drier climates than bulkier mountains
of the same height.)</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Biologists have developed several systems for classifying assemblages
of plants and animals over broad regions, and one of
the most widely known is that of C. Hart Merriam. Around the
turn of the century, he conceived a system of &ldquo;life zones,&rdquo; named
for the parts of the continent where they are best developed:
Tropical, Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Canadian,
Hudsonian, and Arctic. In Saguaro National Monument, the Lower
Sonoran Zone corresponds to the desert scrub type; the Upper
Sonoran includes desert grassland transition, oak woodland, and
oak-pine woodland; the Transition Zone is equivalent to the
ponderosa pine forest; and the poorly represented Canadian Zone
has Douglas-fir and white fir. Because Merriam&rsquo;s system is so
widely used, his terms are included in the tabulation on page 20,
which summarizes the main characteristics of plant zones in the
monument.</p>
<p>The best way to appreciate the biotic changes that occur with
elevation is to walk or ride a horse to the top of the Rincons. But
if your time or energy is limited you can get a quick view of these
sequences by driving up nearby Mount Lemmon, in the Santa
Catalina Mountains.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">desert plants</span></h2>
<p>When you look out over the cactus forest, in either part of Saguaro
National Monument, you may think there&rsquo;s a sameness to it in
all directions&mdash;saguaros standing amid scattered shrubs. But look
harder, or walk about, and you will discover variations in the
scene. First, there is a gradual change in the vegetation from the
mountain foot down the bajada or pediment to the valley floor,
as saguaros and paloverdes (green) become sparser and creosotebushes
(smaller and brownish) take over. (The monument itself
does not extend far enough from the mountain bases to include
extensive creosotebush communities, but these cover large areas
in the lowest parts of the valleys.) Then there is the luxuriant
growth along washes, where mesquites and paloverdes grow to
tree size and there are more kinds of plants. And if you are observant
you may notice slight variations with each change in slope
on the rolling hills&mdash;for example, more grass growing on their
north sides. On another scale, you can see separate little communities
of plants in special situations, as under shrubs or on rocks.</p>
<p>These patterns are due to variations in the environment. For
the desert is hotter and drier in some places than in others. The
gradual downslope changes in vegetation reflect the decrease in
the amount of soil moisture available to plants&mdash;a condition
caused by the decreasing size of soil particles and consequent
shrinkage of water-holding space between particles. Desert washes
encourage plant growth because they channel water and cold air.
Strangely enough, night temperatures are often lower in a desert
valley than farther up the slopes. This &ldquo;inversion&rdquo; is due to drainage
of cold air down mountainsides, forming cold &ldquo;pools&rdquo; in valley
bottoms, especially in winter. Cold air is heavier than warm, and
(since air flows much like water) it is channeled down the draws&mdash;a
fact that will strike you if you walk into a wash near the mountains
at night or early in the morning. Add this phenomenon to
the great amounts of moisture that lie beneath the surface of
washes, and you can see that desert drainageways are really linear
oases. More subtly, desert hills reflect in their vegetation the
differences in soil moisture from north slopes to south slopes
caused by increasing exposure to sunlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>One controlling factor, then, is dominant in the desert: the
scarcity of water. This results not only in the unusual forms and
adaptations of desert plants, but also in a distinctive type of plant
community. In wetter climes, plants compete mostly for sunlight.
They can grow close together, as long as they receive adequate
illumination. During the regrowth of forests, several distinct sets
of plants appear, each succeeding group more tolerant of shade
than the last, as the forest canopy closes. In the desert, there is
no such succession. Clear a patch of desert vegetation, and the
same species will reappear&mdash;spaced out, with bare ground between
them as before. For here sunlight is abundant (we might say overabundant),
but there is not enough water to allow plants to cover
the ground.</p>
<p>Dr. Forrest Shreve, who was a botanist at the Carnegie Institution&rsquo;s
Desert Laboratory near Tucson and a master student of
deserts, defined a desert as &ldquo;an area in which deficient and uncertain
rainfall ... has made a strong impression on the structure,
functions, and behavior of living things.&rdquo; The distinctive characteristics
of desert plants and animals have evolved through millions
of years, in a trial-and-error process in which only the better-fitted
forms have survived. It would be enlightening to know how many
of the species and varieties of plants that developed during the
past 60 million years or so have failed to adapt to Sonoran Desert
conditions. It is fascinating to study the hundreds of forms that
have succeeded and to try to determine what structures they have
perfected and what methods they have originated that enabled
them to maintain themselves in such a harsh environment.</p>
<p>Desert plants can be classified as &ldquo;escapers,&rdquo; &ldquo;evaders,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;resisters,&rdquo; according to their means of adaptation to water shortage.
Escapers, such as the annuals, avoid the problem entirely
by waiting out the dry periods as seeds, to sprout and reproduce
only when the rains come. Evaders, such as the ocotillo, reduce
their water loss during droughts by such methods as dropping their
leaves or going into a state of dormancy. Resisters, however,
&ldquo;hang in there&rdquo; all year, taking the desert&rsquo;s worst. The cactuses,
prime examples of this group, rapidly soak up water from each
rain and store it for use during drought; the mesquite&rsquo;s deep roots
tap a more constant source of moisture.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Succulents</h3>
<p>A large group of desert plants conserve water for use in periods
of drought by storing it in specialized tissues during the wet
season. Some of these &ldquo;succulents,&rdquo; principally the yuccas,
eschevarias, and agaves, have developed water-storage tissues in
their leaves. A few, notably the <span class="small">NIGHTBLOOMING CEREUS</span> (see
<a href="#c27">appendix</a> for scientific names of plants), have slender stems but
an enormous, carrot-shaped root in which the moisture-storage
tissue is located. The <span class="small">GOURDS</span> also have large, thick, moisture-retaining
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
roots, as does the <span class="small">WILD-CUCUMBER</span>.</p>
<p>The cactuses store water in their stems and thus are called stem
succulents. In the course of its evolution the cactus has eliminated
leaves, and their function has been taken over by the green outer
covering of the stems. Thus the amount of transpiration (moisture
loss through plant breathing pores) has been greatly reduced.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="442" />
<p class="pcap">Saguaro buds.</p>
</div>
<p>The cactuses are thought to have evolved from relatives of the
rose family in the West Indies, beginning some 18,000 to 20,000
years ago. From there they spread to most parts of the Western
Hemisphere, but particularly to the drier regions, changing their
forms to meet new conditions. One of the youngest of plant
families, the cactuses are still evolving rapidly. This doesn&rsquo;t make
the task of classifying them easier for the taxonomists.</p>
<p>In varied forms, cactuses enliven the paloverde-saguaro community.
In size they range from tiny button and pincushion types,
some of which weigh only a few ounces, to the giant saguaro, the
bulkiest of which may weigh several tons.</p>
<p>Cactuses as a group are easily recognized, although many people
mistakenly believe that any desert plant with spines or thorns is
a cactus. Shreve describes their main characteristics thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Several structural features have served to give the cacti their
outstanding appearance, so unlike that of other plants. Most
general have been the loss of the leaf as a permanent organ, the
enlargement of the stem to accommodate water-storing tissue,
and the development of local spinebearing structures known as
&ldquo;areoles.&rdquo; In several genera, the stem is segmented into sections
which are flat and somewhat leaflike; in others the stem is round,
much branched, and the surface occupied by close-set tubercles.
In a large group, including massive erect forms, as well as
slender climbing ones, the stem is grooved or fluted and thus
able readily to accommodate its surface to great fluctuations in
the water content of the tissues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are trying to identify species, however, cactuses can be
annoying, since they often hybridize. You must expect to find
some individuals that don&rsquo;t fit the book descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><i>The Saguaro&mdash;Monarch of the Monument</i></h3>
<p>Of all the species of cactus recorded in Saguaro National Monument,
the giant <span class="small">SAGUARO</span> (pronounced sah-<span class="small">WAH</span>-roe) holds the
center of interest. From the visitor&rsquo;s standpoint, all other plants,
no matter how bizarre in appearance or peculiar in living habits,
are merely stage scenery for setting off the star of the desert drama.
For size, this vegetable mammoth tops all other succulents of this
country; heights of more than 50 feet and weights of more than 5
tons have been reported. There have been specimens with more
than 50 arms, or branches. Although no accurate method of
determining saguaro age has been devised, it is estimated that an
occasional veteran may reach the two-century mark.</p>
<p>Structurally, the giant cactus is well adapted to meet the stern
requirements of its habitat. Its widespread root system, as much
as 70 feet in diameter, lying close to the surface of the ground,
anchors and holds the heavy plant erect. The shallow root system
quickly and efficiently collects and channels to the main stem
any moisture that may penetrate the topsoil. The trunk and
branches have a cylindrical framework of long slender poles or
ribs fused at the constricted base. This woody skeleton supports
the mass of pulpy tissue, the whole being covered with tough,
waxy, spine-bearing &ldquo;skin.&rdquo; Numerous vertical ridges, like the
pleats of a huge accordion, permit the stems and branches to
expand in girth as the tissues swell with water during wet weather
and to shrink during times of drought.</p>
<p>So efficient is the saguaro&rsquo;s water-storage system that, even after
years of extreme drought, the plant retains enough moisture in
reserve to enable it to produce flower buds. The buds appear in
vertical rows at the tips of the main stem and branches, a few
opening each evening over a period of several weeks in May and
June. The flowers, up to 4 inches in diameter, have waxy white
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
petals. This beautiful blossom is the State flower of Arizona. The
egg-shaped fruits mature in late June and July, splitting open
when ripe to reveal masses of juicy, deep-red pulp filled with tiny
black seeds. Pulp and seeds are consumed by several kinds of
birds, especially white-winged doves. Many fruits that fall to the
ground are promptly eaten by rodents and other animals.</p>
<p>Indians, too, eat the fruits. European explorers who followed
Coronado&rsquo;s expedition into this region found peaceful Papagos and
Opatas living here, hunting animals and utilizing many native
plants. Among the most dependable of Papago food sources was
the fruit of the giant cactus. So important was this fruit harvest
in their economy that they designated this season as the start of
the new year. Today, in some parts of the desert, Pima and
Papago Indians still harvest the fruits. The word &ldquo;saguaro&rdquo; is
believed to derive from a Spanish corruption of a Papago word for
the big cactus.</p>

</div>
<p>Saguaros provide not only food for man and beast, but homes
for animals. Walk through a giant cactus forest and you will be
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
amazed at the number of holes drilled in these plants. The holes
are made by Gila woodpeckers and related gilded flickers, which
often relinquish them after one nesting season. The next occupant
may be any of a host of desert dwellers, including screech and
elf owls, purple martins, and invertebrates. Some birds use the
plant as a foundation for their homes. White-winged doves, for
instance, often build flimsy stick platforms on the tips of saguaro
arms; red-tailed hawks and horned owls construct more substantial
nests in the forks.</p>
<p>Although billions of saguaro seeds are produced yearly in the
extensive stands of the monument, only a very few find favorable
locations for germination and growth. Trees, rocks, dead limbs,
pebbles&mdash;anything that reduces evaporation in the immediate
vicinity of the seed&mdash;improve the chance of germination. These
kinds of shelter not only provide the necessary moisture conditions,
but also hide the seed from armies of ants, rodents, and
other animals searching for food.</p>

<p>Early growth is extremely slow. A 2-year-old saguaro may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
only one-quarter of an inch in diameter, and a 9-year-old plant
may be 6 inches high. These years are the most hazardous. Insect
larvae devour the tiny cactuses. Woodrats and other rodents chew
the succulent tissue for its water, and ground squirrels uproot the
young plants with their digging. In later life, the saguaro must
contend with uprooting wind and human vandalism, as well as
the earlier foes&mdash;drought, frost, erosion, and animals.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Gila woodpecker at its nesting hole.</p>
</div>
<p>In a century of maturity, a saguaro may produce 50 million
seeds; replacement of the parent plant would require only that
one of these germinate and grow. But in the cactus forest of the
Rincon Mountain Section, the rate of survival has been even
lower, so that over the last few decades the stand has been
dwindling. What is wrong?</p>
<p>Many answers to this question have been advanced, but like all
interrelationships in nature, the saguaro&rsquo;s role in the desert web
of life is very complex, and involves past events as well as present
ones; a partial answer to the problem may be all we can hope for.
The following reasons for the decline of the saguaros have been
suggested by researchers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<div class="img" id="fig18">

<p class="pcap">A typical 4-foot saguaro.</p>
</div>
<p>There is some evidence to suggest that the Southwest has been
getting drier since at least the late 19th century, and while the
saguaro is adapted to extreme aridity, some of the &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; plants
that shelter it during infancy are not. If such shrubs as paloverdes
and mesquites dwindle, it is argued, so must the saguaro,
which in its early years depends on them for shade.</p>
<p>Other culprits in the saguaro problem are man himself and his
livestock. Around 1880, soon after the first railroad reached
Tucson, a cattle boom began in southern Arizona. The valleys
were soon overstocked, and cattle scoured the mountainsides in
search of food. By 1893, when drought and starvation decimated
the herds, the land had been severely overgrazed. Though the
monument was established in 1933, grazing in the Rincon Mountain
Section&rsquo;s main cactus forest continued until 1958. (Elsewhere
in the monument, it still goes on.) Compounding the problem,
woodcutters removed acres of mesquite and other trees. In the
center of the present Cactus Forest Loop Drive, lime kilns devoured
quantities of woody fuel. Further upsetting the desert&rsquo;s
natural balance, ranchers and Government agents poisoned coyotes
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
and shot hawks and other predators&mdash;in the belief that this would
benefit the owners of livestock.</p>
<p>This unrestrained assault on the environment had unfortunate
effects on saguaros as well as on the human economy. Overgrazing
may have resulted in an increase in kangaroo rats (which
benefit from bare ground on which to hunt seeds) and certain
other rodents adapted to an open sort of ground cover. Man&rsquo;s
killing of predators, their natural enemies, further encouraged
proliferation of these rodents, which some people say are especially
destructive of saguaro seeds and young plants. Whatever the
effect these rodents have on the saguaros, the removal of ground
cover intensified erosion and reduced the chances for the seeds to
germinate and grow. And certainly the cutting of desert trees
removed shade that would have benefited young saguaros. In the
Tucson Mountain Section, which is near the northeastern edge of
the Sonoran Desert, freezing temperatures are perhaps the most
important environmental factor in saguaro mortality.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="375" />
<p class="pcap">Looking toward the Santa Catalina Mountains from Cactus Forest Drive in September 1942.</p>
</div>
<p>Although the causes of decline of the cactus forest lying northwest
of Tanque Verde Ridge are still something of a puzzle, several
facts are clear: the saguaro is not becoming extinct; in rocky
habitats many young saguaros are surviving, promising continued
stands for the future; in non-rocky habitats, some young saguaros
are surviving, ensuring that at least thin stands will endure in
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
these areas. Furthermore, since grazing was stopped here, ground
cover has improved&mdash;a plus factor for the saguaro&rsquo;s welfare. On
the negative side, it is possible that, in addition to suffering from
climatic, biotic, and human pressures, the once-dense mature
stands of the monument are in the down-phase of a natural fluctuation.
It is possible, too, that these stands owed their exceptional
richness to an unusually favorable past environment which
may not occur again. We can hope, however, that sometime in
the not-distant future the total environmental balance will shift
once again in favor of the giant cactus.</p>

<p>Many other cactuses share the saguaro&rsquo;s environment. The
<span class="small">BARREL CACTUS</span> is sometimes mistaken for a young saguaro, but
can easily be distinguished by its curved red spines. Stocky and
unbranching, this cactus rarely attains a height of more than 5
or 6 feet. It bears clusters of sharp spines, called &ldquo;areoles,&rdquo; with
the stout central spine flattened and curved like a fishhook. In
bloom, in late summer or early autumn, this succulent plant produces
clusters of yellow or orange flowers on its crown. The
widely circulated story that water can be obtained by tapping the
barrel cactus has little basis in fact, although it is possible that
the thick, bitter juice squeezed from the plant&rsquo;s moist tissues might,
under extreme conditions, prevent death from thirst. Desert rats,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
mice, and rabbits, carefully avoiding the spines, sometimes gnaw
into the plant&rsquo;s tissues to obtain moisture.</p>
<p>The group of cactuses called opuntias (oh-<span class="small">POON</span>-cha) have
jointed stems and branches. They are common and widespread
throughout the desert and are well represented in the monument.</p>
<p>Those having cylindrical joints are known as chollas (<span class="small">CHO</span>-yah),
while those with flat or padlike joints are called pricklypears.</p>
<p>Chollas range in size and form from low mats to small trees,
but most of those in the monument are shrublike. <span class="small">TEDDY BEAR
CHOLLA</span>, infamous for its barbed, hard-to-remove-from-your-skin
spines, forms thick stands on warm south- or west-facing slopes.
Its dense armor of straw-colored spines and its black trunk identify
it. Because its joints break off easily when in contact with
man or animal, this uncuddly customer is popularly called &ldquo;jumping
cactus.&rdquo; A similar species is <span class="small">CHAIN FRUIT CHOLLA</span>, notable for
its long, branched chains of fruit, which sometimes extend to the
ground. Each year, the new flowers blossom from the persistent
fruit of the previous year. There is a common variety of this
species that is almost spineless. <span class="small">STAGHORN CHOLLA</span>, an inhabitant
primarily of washes and other damp places, is named from its
antler-shaped stems. This cactus&rsquo; scientific name&mdash;<i>Opuntia versicolor</i>&mdash;refers
to the fact that its flowers, which appear in April
and May, may be yellow, red, green, or brown. (Each plant sticks
with one color through its lifetime.) Among the smaller chollas,
thin-stemmed <span class="small">PENCIL CHOLLA</span> grows from 2 to 4 feet high on
plains and sandy washes. <span class="small">DESERT CHRISTMAS CACTUS</span>, almost mat-like
in form, blooms in late spring but develops brilliant red fruits
which last through the winter.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p><span class="small">PRICKLYPEARS</span>, like many of the chollas, produce large blossoms
in late spring. Those on the monument are principally the yellow-flowered
species. The reddish brown-to-mahogany colored edible
fruits, called tunas, attain the size of large strawberries. When
mature in autumn, they are consumed by many desert animals.</p>
<p>Some of the smaller cactuses are so tiny as to be unnoticeable
except when in bloom; examples are the <span class="small">HEDGEHOGS</span>, the <span class="small">FISHHOOKS</span>,
and the <span class="small">PINCUSHIONS</span>. Blossoms of some of these ground-hugging
species are large, in some cases larger than the rest of
the plant, and spectacular in form and color. All add to the
monument&rsquo;s spring and early summer display of floral beauty.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Non-Succulents</h3>
<p>For the diversity of devices for adaptation to an inhospitable environment,
the many species making up the non-succulent desert
vegetation provide an absorbing field for study. As we have seen,
there are two ways to survive the harsh desert climate; one is to
avoid the periods of excessive heat and drought (&ldquo;escapers&rdquo;); the
other is to adopt various protective devices (&ldquo;evaders&rdquo; and &ldquo;resisters&rdquo;).
Short-lived plants follow the first method; perennials, the
second.</p>
<h3 id="c11"><i>Perennials</i></h3>
<p>Chief among the requirements for year-round survival in the desert
is a plant&rsquo;s ability to control transpiration and thus maintain a
balance between water loss and water supply. In this struggle,
the hours of darkness are a great aid because in the cool of the
night the air is unable to take up as much moisture as it does
under the influence of the sun&rsquo;s evaporating heat. Therefore, less
exhaling and evaporating of water occurs from plants, and both
the rate and the amount of water loss are reduced. This reduction
in transpiration at night allows the plants to recover from the
severe drying effects of the day. One biologist may have been
close to the truth when he stated, &ldquo;If the celestial machinery should
break down so that just one night were omitted in the midst of
a dry season, it would spell the doom of half the nonsucculent
plants in the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the common trees in the desert part of the monument
is the <span class="small">MESQUITE</span> (mess-<span class="small">KEET</span>). In general appearance it resembles
a small, spiny apple or peach tree with finely divided leaves. Its
roots sometimes penetrate to a depth of 40 or more feet, thus
securing moisture at the deeper, cooler soil levels, from a supply
that remains nearly constant throughout the year. This enables
the tree to expose a rather large expanse of leaf surface without
losing more water than it can replace. A number of mechanical
devices help the tree reduce its water loss during the driest part
of the day (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Among these are its ability to
fold its leaves and close the stomata (breathing pores), thereby
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
greatly reducing the surface area exposed to exhaling and evaporating
influences. In April and May, mesquite trees are covered
with pale-yellow, catkinlike flowers which attract swarms of insects.
These flowers develop to stringbeanlike pods rich in sugar
and important as food for deer and other animals. In earlier days,
the mesquite was also a valuable source of food and firewood for
Indians and pioneers.</p>

</div>
<p>Another desert tree abundant in the monument is the <span class="small">YELLOW
PALOVERDE</span>. It is somewhat similar in size and general shape to
the mesquite. Lacking the deeply penetrating root system of the
mesquite, the paloverde (Spanish word meaning &ldquo;green stick&rdquo;)
has no dependable moisture source; but it has made unusual
adaptations that enable it to retain as much as possible of the
water collected by its roots. In early spring the tree leafs out in
dense foliage, which is followed closely by a blanket of yellow
blossoms. At this season the paloverdes provide one of the most
spectacular displays of the desert, particularly along washes, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
they grow especially well. Blue paloverde, growing in the arroyos,
blooms well every year. Yellow, or foothill, paloverde, a separate
species, blooms only if the soil moisture is high following
winter rains.</p>
<p>With the coming of the hot, drying weather of late spring, the
trees need to reduce their moisture losses. They gradually drop
their leaves until, by early summer, each tree has become practically
bare. The trees do not enter a period of dormancy, but
are able to remain active because their green bark contains chlorophyll.
Thus, the bark takes over some of the food-manufacturing
function normally performed by leaves, but without the high rate
of water loss.</p>
<p>Carrying the drought-evasion habits of the paloverde a step
further, the <span class="small">OCOTILLO</span> (oh-koh-<span class="small">TEE</span>-yoh) comes into full leaf following
each rainy spell during the warmer months. During the
intervening dry periods it sheds its foliage. The ocotillo, a common
and conspicuous desert dweller, is a shrub of striking appearance,
with thorny, whiplike, unbranching stems 8 to 12 feet
long growing upward in a funnel-shaped cluster. In spring, showy
scarlet flower clusters appear at the tips of the stems, making each
plant a glowing splash of color.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="398" />
<p class="pcap">Mesquite in bloom.</p>
</div>
<p>A number of desert shrubs fail to display as much ingenuity
as the paloverde. Some of these evade the dry season simply by
going into a state of dormancy. The <span class="small">WOLFBERRY</span> bursts into full
leaf soon after the first winter rains and blossoms as early as
January. Its small, tomato-red, juicy fruits are sought by birds,
which also find protective cover for their nests and for overnight
perches in the stiff, thorny shrubs. In the past, the berrylike fruits
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
were important to the Indians, who ate them raw or made them
into a sauce.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/i021a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="888" />
<p class="pcap">Yellow paloverde, Tucson Mountain Section.</p>
</div>
<p>Commonest of the conspicuous desert non-succulent shrubs is
the wispy-looking but tough <span class="small">CREOSOTEBUSH</span>, found principally on
poor soils and on the desert flats between mountain ranges. It
is also sprinkled throughout the paloverde-saguaro community
in the monument. A new crop of wax-coated, musty-smelling
leaves, giving the plant the local (but mistaken) name &ldquo;grease-wood,&rdquo;
appears as early as January. The leaves are followed by
a profuse blooming of small yellow flowers and cottony seed balls.
During abnormally moist summers or in damp locations, the leaves
and flowers persist the year round; but usually the coming of dry
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
weather brings an end to the blossoming period. If the dry spell
is exceptionally long, the leaves turn brown, and the plants remain
dormant until awakened by the next winter&rsquo;s rainfall. Pima Indians
formerly gathered a resinous material, known as lac, which accumulates
on the bark of its branches, and used it to mend pottery and
fasten arrow points. They also steeped the leaves to obtain an
antiseptic medicine. Ground squirrels commonly feed on the seeds.</p>

<p class="pcap">Parry&rsquo;s penstemon.</p>
</div>
<p>A large shrub of open, sprawling growth usually found along
desert washes in company with mesquite is <span class="small">CATCLAW</span>. Its name
refers to the small curved thorns that hide on its branches. In
April and May, the small trees are covered with fragrant, pale-yellow,
catkinlike flower clusters that attract swarms of insects.
The seed pods were ground into meal by the Indians and eaten
as mush and cakes.</p>
<p>In lower elevations of the Tucson Mountain Section, the gray-blue
foliage of <span class="small">IRONWOOD</span> is a common sight, but the species does
not range farther eastward. Its wisterialike lavender-and-white
flowers blossom in May and June. The nutritious seeds are harvested
by rodents and formerly were parched and eaten by Indians.
The wood is so dense that it sinks in water; Indians used
it for making arrowheads and tool handles.</p>
<p>Ferns&mdash;commonly, plants of dank woods and other moist habitats&mdash;seem
entirely out of place in the desert; nevertheless, some
members of the fern family have overcome drought conditions.
The <span class="small">GOLDFERN</span> is common on rocky ledges, where it persists by
means of special drought-resistant cells.</p>
<p>Among the smaller perennials are many that add to spring
flower displays when conditions of moisture and temperature are
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
favorable. Perennials do not need to mature their seeds before
the coming of summer as do the ephemerals; a majority start
blossoming somewhat later in the spring, and gaily flaunt their
flowers long after the annuals have faded and died. When the
heat and drought of early summer begin to bear down, they gradually
die back, surviving the &ldquo;long dry&rdquo; by their persistent roots
and larger stems. One of the most noticeable and beautiful of
this group of small perennials fairly common in the monument is
<span class="small">PARRY&rsquo;S PENSTEMON</span>. It occurs in scattered clumps on well-drained
slopes along the base of Tanque Verde Ridge. The showy
rose-magenta flowers and the glossy-green leaves arise from erect
stems that may grow 4 feet tall in favorable seasons.</p>
<p>Among the first of the shrubby perennials to cover the rocky
hillsides with a blanket of winter and springtime bloom is the
<span class="small">BRITTLEBUSH</span>. Masses of yellow sunflowerlike blossoms are borne
on long stems that exude a gum which was chewed by the Indians
and was also burned as incense in early mission churches.</p>
<p>A conspicuous perennial that survives the dry season as an
underground bulb is <span class="small">BLUEDICKS</span>. Although it doesn&rsquo;t occur in
massed bloom, it does add spots of color to the desert scene.
Usually appearing from February to May, bluedicks has violet
flower clusters on long, slender, erect stems. The bulbs were dug
and eaten by Pima and Papago Indians.</p>
<p>Although neither conspicuous nor attractive, the common <span class="small">TRIANGLE
BURSAGE</span> is an important part of the paloverde-saguaro
community in the Tucson Mountains. A low, rounded, white-barked
shrub, bursage has small, colorless flowers without petals.
(Being wind-pollinated, the flowers do not need to attract insects.)</p>
<p>One of the handsome shrubs abundant in the high desert along
the base of Tanque Verde Ridge is the <span class="small">JOJOBA</span> (ho-<span class="small">HOH</span>-bah),
or deernut. Its thick, leathery, evergreen leaves are especially
noticeable in winter and furnish excellent browse for deer. The
flowers are small and yellowish, but the nutlike fruits are large
and edible, although bitter. They were eaten raw or parched by
the Indians, and were pulverized by early-day settlers for use as
a coffee substitute.</p>
<p>Among the attractive flowering shrubs are the <span class="small">INDIGOBUSHES</span>,
of which there are several species adapted to the desert environment.
The local, low-growing indigobushes are especially ornamental
when covered with masses of deep-blue flowers in spring.</p>
<p>Another small shrub, noticeable from February to May because
of its large, tassel-like pink-to-red blossoms and its fernlike
leaves is <span class="small">FAIRY-DUSTER</span>. Deer browse on its delicate foliage.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">PAPER FLOWER</span>, growing in dome-shaped clumps covered
with yellow flowers, sometimes blooms throughout the entire year.
The petals bleach and dry and may remain on the plant weeks
after the blossoms have faded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Quick to attract attention because of their apparent lack of
foliage, the <span class="small">JOINTFIRS</span>, of which there are several desert species,
grow in clumps of harsh, stringy, yellow-green, erect stems. The
skin or outer bark of the stems performs the usual functions of
leaves, which on these plants have been reduced to scales. Small,
fragrant, yellow blossom clusters, appearing at the stem joints in
spring, are visited by insects attracted to their nectar.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><i>Ephemerals</i></h3>
<p>Every spring, after a winter of normal rainfall, parts of the southwestern
deserts are carpeted with a lush blanket of fast-growing
annual herbs and wildflowers&mdash;the early spring ephemerals. The
monument does not get massive displays, however, since it is
lacking in the species that make the best show. But it does have
many annuals that are beautiful individually or in small groups.
Many of these &ldquo;quickies&rdquo; do not have the characteristics of desert
plants; some of them, in fact, are part of the common vegetation
of other climes where moisture is plentiful and summer temperatures
are much less severe.</p>
<p>What are these &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; plants doing in the desert, and how
do they survive? With its often frostfree winter climate and its
normal December-to-March rains, the desert presents in early
spring ideal growing weather for annuals that are able to compress
a generation into several months. Several hundred species
of plants have taken advantage of this situation.</p>
<p>There is <span class="small">WILD CARROT</span>, which is a summer plant in South Carolina
and a winter annual in California (where it is called &ldquo;rattlesnake
weed&rdquo;). In the desert, its seeds lie dormant in the soil
through the long, hot summer and the drying weather of autumn.
Then, under the influence of winter rains and the soil-warming
effects of early spring sunshine, they burst into rapid growth. One
of a host of species, this early spring ephemeral is enabled by these
favorable conditions to flower and mature its seed before the pall
of summer heat and drought descends upon the desert. With their
task complete, the parents wither and die. Their ripened seeds
are scattered over the desert until winter rains enable them to
cover the desert with another multicolored but short-lived carpet
of foliage and bloom.</p>
<p>The one-season ephemerals do not limit themselves to the winter
growing period. From July to September, local thundershowers
deluge parts of the desert while other areas, not so fortunate, remain
dry. Where rain has fallen, another and entirely different group of
plants, called the summer ephemerals, find ideal conditions for
growth and take their turn at weaving a desert carpet. Their seeds
have lain dormant over winter. These summer &ldquo;quickies&rdquo; are plants
that, farther south in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico, flourish
during the winter rainy season. Saguaro National Monument is
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
doubly fortunate in that it lies within a section of desert having not
only its own year-round vegetation, but also summer wildflowers
&ldquo;borrowed,&rdquo; for winter use, from its eastern and western neighbors,
and winter wildflowers for summer decorations from its southern
neighbors.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Phacelia, an ephemeral.</p>
</div>
<p>The short-lived leafy plants of summer and winter are able to
compress their entire active life into 6 to 12 weeks when conditions
are most suitable. Thus, they can escape all the rigorous
periods of the desert climate by living for 8 or 9 months in the
dormant seed stage. Some of the spectacular and colorful flowers
of the monument are among these ephemerals that survive desert
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
conditions by escaping them. It must be remembered, however,
that when drought conditions or abnormally cold spring weather
upset the norm&mdash;a not unusual occurrence&mdash;response of ephemeral
plants is greatly restricted. If suitable conditions do not develop
during the season for growth of a particular kind of ephemeral,
its seeds will simply wait a year or more until conditions
are favorable.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="418" />
<p class="pcap">White tackstem.</p>
</div>
<p>How do the seeds of ephemerals &ldquo;know&rdquo; when it is time to
germinate? Experiments have revealed that the seeds of annuals
will germinate only when enough water percolates through the
soil to dissolve away a &ldquo;growth inhibitor&rdquo; in their coats. A single
light rain will not do the job. In this way premature sprouting
into a too-dry environment is prevented. The winter annuals,
furthermore, will only germinate when soils are cool, and the
summer annuals when soils are warm. These finely tuned adaptations
thus allow plantlife to take full advantage of favorable seasons
in the desert.</p>
<p>Early spring ephemerals climax their show in March. From late
February to mid-April they are completing their growth and putting
forth the precious seeds that will assure survival for the next
generation. At the head of this parade of flowers in the monument
is a purple-blossomed immigrant from the Mediterranean,
the now thoroughly naturalized <span class="small">FILAREE</span>. In addition to the small
purple flowers, which may appear as early as January, the conspicuous
&ldquo;tailed&rdquo; fruits almost always attract attention. When dry,
they are tightly twisted, corkscrewlike; when damp they uncoil,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
forcing the needle-tipped seeds into the soil.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig36">
<img src="images/i024a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="407" />
<p class="pcap">Desert-marigold.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="small">INDIAN WHEAT</span> is one of the first plants to lay a green carpet
over the sandy desert floor in spring. The tan, individual flower
heads are conspicuous, but their numerous, close-growing spikes
form a thick, luxuriant, pilelike ground cover. The countless tiny
seeds are eagerly sought each spring by coveys of Gambel&rsquo;s quail,
and are also harvested by Pima and Papago Indians.</p>
<p><span class="small">DESERT CHICORY</span> is somewhat like the common yellow dandelion
but is longer stemmed and less coarse. Its white or butter-yellow
blossoms make it one of the noticeable spring annuals in
the desert. It rarely grows in pure stands but appears in conspicuous
clumps among other short-lived plants.</p>
<p>Somewhat similar in appearance to desert chicory is <span class="small">WHITE
TACKSTEM</span>, one of the handsomest of the spring quickies. It is
usually found on dry, rocky hillsides and has white or rose-colored
flowers. Its name is derived from the presence of small glands
which protrude in the manner of tiny tacks partially driven into
the stems.</p>
<p>Following abnormally wet winters, <span class="small">FIDDLENECK</span> covers patches
of sandy or gravelly soil with a dense growth of bristly erect
plants. These bear tight clusters of small yellow-orange blossoms
arranged along a curling flower stem resembling the scroll end of
a violin, hence the name. This plant, favored by the same growing
conditions as creosotebush, frequently forms a dense though short-lived
growth around the bases of those shrubs.</p>
<p>Associated with fiddleneck and creosotebush, <span class="small">SCORPIONWEED</span>
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
adds its violet-purple blooms to the spring flower display following
winters of above-normal precipitation. The name is derived
from the curling habit of the blossom heads, which may remind
the observer of the flexed tail of a scorpion. Touching the plant
may cause skin irritation in susceptible individuals. Unfortunately,
scorpionweed is also widely known as wild-heliotrope, thus contributing
to the confusion engendered by duplication of popular
names. The plant properly called <span class="small">WILD-HELIOTROPE</span> is similar in
general appearance, but the flowers are white to pale purple and
their odor is more pleasing than that of the scorpionweed. Wild-heliotrope,
or &ldquo;quailplant,&rdquo; is another of the early spring ephemerals,
but under favorable conditions, where soils are moist, it
may continue to live and bloom throughout the year.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/i025.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="465" />
<p class="pcap">Bladder-pod.</p>
</div>
<p>Growing in sandy locations and quite noticeable because of
its large, yellow, showy, long-stemmed flower heads, the <span class="small">DESERT-MARIGOLD</span>
helps to open the spring blossoming season. Where
moisture conditions are favorable, these plants may continue to
bloom throughout the summer and well into autumn. Sometimes,
during the hottest, driest time of the year, desert-marigolds are
among the very few blossoms brightening the desert floor. Their
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
bleached, papery petals persist for days after the flowers have
faded, giving the plant the name paper-daisy.</p>
<p>One of the few species that makes a carpet of color in the
monument is the tiny <span class="small">BLADDER-POD</span>. This low-growing annual of
the mustard family begins to cover open stretches of desert with
a yellow blanket in late February or early March following wet
winters. Bladder-pod is usually found in pure stands surrounding
islands of cholla, creosotebush, and paloverde. It also mingles
with other spring ephemerals, where it is promptly submerged by
the ranker, taller-growing, more conspicuous annuals.</p>
<p>Illustrating one of the interesting phases in evolutionary variations
among plants, the <span class="small">LUPINES</span> are represented by several species
which are able to survive and prosper in the desert. Some of the
lupines are annuals of the quickie type; others are perennials with
a life cycle of several years. Some of these longer-lived species
join the ephemerals in the spring flower show, while others are
more leisurely in approaching their blossoming time.</p>

<p>The fauna of each community is made up of animals adapted
to the climatic conditions and the available food, cover, and water.
In Saguaro, some animals, such as the desert kangaroo rat and
the cactus wren, are restricted by their life requirements to a narrow
belt; others, such as the gray fox and great horned owl, are more
adaptable and live in all the major plant communities.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">plants of the hills</span>
<br />and mountains</h2>
<p>Most visitors to the monument see only a small part of it&mdash;the
lowland cactus forests. But above the desert in the high back
country of the Rincon Mountains is another world. These highlands
are accessible only on foot or horseback; and they should
remain so, for they are now in the last major roadless range in
southern Arizona, and as such their wilderness value appreciates
yearly. Interesting scenic trails reach the high places of the Tucson
Mountains, too, but to see the greatest changes in plantlife you
must climb the higher Rincons.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Oak-Pine Woodland</h3>
<p>The thinning and final disappearance of saguaros along the trailside,
although mesquite and ocotillos seem almost as numerous as
on the floor of the desert, indicate that you are entering a slightly
cooler, wetter environment. An occasional <span class="small">MEXICAN BLUE OAK</span>
or <span class="small">ARIZONA ROSEWOOD</span> appears among the mesquites along the
washes. The grasses that increasingly cover the ground as you climb
include <span class="small">HAIRY</span>, <span class="small">SIDEOATS</span>, and <span class="small">SPRUCETOP GRAMA</span>;
<span class="small">CURLY MESQUITEGRASS</span>;
<span class="small">TANGLEHEAD</span>; <span class="small">TEXAS BLUESTEM</span>; and <span class="small">WOLFTAIL</span>. Mingling
with them are <span class="small">TURPENTINE-BUSH</span> and shrubby <span class="small">SNAKEWEED</span>.</p>
<p>A spectacular inhabitant of the grassland transition and open
oak woodlands you are now entering is the <span class="small">AMOLE</span>, or <span class="small">SHINDAGGER</span>,
whose rapidly growing blossom stalks attract attention
from May to as late as August. The plants themselves, which
grow crowded together in patches, consist of rosettes of succulent
leaves superficially resembling bunches of flattened, green bananas.
The stiff, needle-sharp leaf tips can inflict painful jabs on
man and beast. During its lifetime, the plant stores food in its
short, thick stem. Finally, after several years, it sends up an unbranched
flower stalk that grows to 5 feet. The light-yellow flowers
mature to brown, capsule-like fruits, after which the plant
dies. The short stems or crowns, containing saponin, were used
by Indians as soap. They also roasted the young bud stalks of
some species by covering them with heated stones in pits.</p>
<p>Two noticeable plants of the lily family which sometimes dominate
gravelly slopes of the grassland-oak woodland belt are the
<span class="small">SOTOL</span> and <span class="small">BEARGRASS</span>, or sacahuista. The former grows from a
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
compact crown as a dense, rather symmetrical cluster of long, thin
ribbonlike leaves, usually grayed at the tips and armed along the
margins with curved thorns. In early summer many small, cream-colored
blossoms develop along the upper extremity of single fast-growing
flower stalks 8 to 10 feet high. The bud stalks formerly
were harvested and roasted by Indians. In Mexico a potent alcoholic
drink, sotol, is distilled from the fermented juice of the
pounded crowns. Sacahuista resembles huge, sprawling clusters
of coarse grass. Flower stalks are short, producing conspicuous,
open, loose sprays of small, tan-to-brownish flowers in May and
June. Indians used the tender bud stalks for food and obtained
fiber from the long, slender leaves, weaving them into baskets and
mats.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="439" />
<p class="pcap">Mexican blue oak foliage.</p>
</div>
<p>Uncommon in the monument, but worthy of mention, are <span class="small">ARIZONA
SYCAMORE</span> and <span class="small">ARIZONA CYPRESS</span>. The latter is restricted
to the east flank of the Rincon Mountains, steep slopes, and deep
canyons, where it grows with the <span class="small">SILVERLEAF</span>, <span class="small">PALMER</span>, <span class="small">EMORY</span>,
and <span class="small">NETLEAF OAKS</span>; mesic shrubs; poison oak; and <span class="small">CALIFORNIA
BUCKTHORN</span>. Arizona sycamore grows along lower-canyon watercourses
such as Chiminea and Rincon Creeks, which drain the
rugged south flank of Mica Mountain and the west flank of Rincon
Peak, respectively.</p>
<p>As you continue to climb, the open, grassy, shrub-dotted slopes
change in places to sprawling thickets, called chaparral. These are
made up of manzanita and skunkbush, <span class="small">SILKTASSEL</span>, evergreen oaks,
and underbrush of smaller shrubs. Among the common oaks are
<span class="small">ARIZONA WHITE OAK</span> and, on drier sites of the Tanque Verde range,
<span class="small">SHRUB LIVE OAK</span>. The oaks furnish protective cover, browse, and
acorns for deer and other mammals and birds, and are of great
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
value in retarding soil erosion on steep gravelly slopes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/i030a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="435" />
<p class="pcap">Turpentine-bush, a member of the sunflower family.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="small">POINTLEAF MANZANITA</span> is especially abundant on the lower
eastern flanks of the Rincon Mountains in the Happy Valley area.
Early in spring the waxy, urn-shaped blossoms, the leathery,
glossy, evergreen leaves, and the typical grotesquely crooked, red-barked
limbs, make manzanita one of the most attractive shrubs
of the chaparral.</p>
<p>Although <span class="small">SKUNKBUSH</span> is a close relative of poison ivy and
sumac, its aromatic foliage is harmless. Growing in compact
thickets, skunkbush provides food and cover for birds and other
small animals. Inconspicuous yellow flowers appear from March
to June, and are followed by berrylike fruits which are dull red
when mature.</p>
<p>As you follow the trail higher, occasional <span class="small">MEXICAN PINYON
PINES</span> and <span class="small">ALLIGATOR JUNIPERS</span> appear. Gradually these evergreens
become more abundant, mingling with the oaks to form
a pigmy oak-pine-juniper forest. Clumps of <span class="small">MOUNTAIN-MAHOGANY</span>
are noticeable, their feathery seed &ldquo;tails&rdquo; gleaming in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Pinyons are among the commonest and most widespread trees
of the middle elevations throughout the Southwest. The Mexican
pinyon, which is the species growing abundantly in the Tanque
Verde-Rincon upland, may be recognized by the fact that its
foliage is in clusters of three needles to the bundle. Its cones
require nearly 2 years to mature and contain hard-shelled seeds or
nuts which are a source of food for many birds and mammals.
These pines are usually shrubby, rarely more than 15 to 25 feet
high, with horizontal, twisted, low-growing limbs. Intermingled
with the pinyons are alligator junipers, often mistakenly called
cedars. Those in the monument are conspicuous because their
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
platy bark forms an attractive pattern resembling the squarish-scaled
skin of alligators. The berrylike cones are soft and mealy,
and are eaten by many kinds of wild animals.</p>
<p>Although the oak-pine woodland supports a heavy stand of
shrubby trees over much of the terrain, there are numerous open
glades and grassy hillsides. In addition to some of the aforementioned
grasses, <span class="small">BLUEGRASS</span>, <span class="small">BULLGRASS</span>, and <span class="small">PLAINS LIVEGRASS</span>
provide ground cover in this belt. Following summer showers,
many flowering herbs brighten the open slopes. Yellow to orange
petals of <span class="small">PUCCOON</span>, and the white to lavender-and-rose blossoms
of <span class="small">MOCK-PENNYROYAL</span> and <span class="small">HOUSTONIA</span> are among those seen along
the trailside.</p>
<h3 id="c16">Ponderosa Pine Forest</h3>
<p>Just as grassland merges with oak woodland and chaparral, and
these with oak-pine woodland, so you will notice, as you climb
steadily higher, that these woodlands gradually mingle with the
open pine forests that cover much of the Rincon Mountains above
6,000 feet. <span class="small">PONDEROSA PINE</span> is the &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; of the Rincons,
usually growing in clear, open stands. Through its high canopy
of spreading branches, sunlight mottles the shaded forest floor. Its
presence indicates still cooler and wetter conditions than those
below. Here you will need blankets at night, though summer days
are warm.</p>
<p>Except for grasses such as <span class="small">PINE DROPSEED</span>, <span class="small">SCREWLEAF MUHLY</span>,
and <span class="small">MOUNTAIN MUHLY</span>, ground cover is scarce. In tree-glades or
on old burns, however, intermediate-type shrubs (such as <span class="small">BUCKBUSH</span>)
and various herbs have established themselves. Some herbs
develop into patches of colorful flowers in summer and autumn.
Common flowering plants found among the pines are <span class="small">COLOGANIA</span>;
<span class="small">PEAVINE</span>, with its large and showy, white, sweetpea-like blossoms
throughout the summer; lupines; <span class="small">DOGBANE</span>; and the familiar white
<span class="small">WESTERN YARROW</span>. Here, too, may be found <span class="small">GROUNDSEL</span>, <span class="small">ASTER</span>,
<span class="small">FLEABANE</span>, and others, often brightened by the presence of butterflies
and other insects seeking nectar and pollen. Most of these
forest flowers bloom in late summer or autumn, when plants in the
desert, far below, are drab and dormant.</p>
<p>Throughout the pine forests, numerous small canyons and rocky
outcrops favor the development of thickets of oak and locust,
frequently growing together. <span class="small">GAMBEL&rsquo;S OAK</span>, a leaf-shedding white
oak, ranges in size from a small shrub to a handsome tree. It has
broad, deeply lobed leaves which provide browse for deer. Its
acorns are consumed by deer, rodents, and birds, including wild
turkeys. The <span class="small">NEW MEXICAN LOCUST</span> also is browsed by deer.
Rarely reaching tree size, this species is an attractive vegetative
cover because of its odd-pinnate leaves and large clusters of purplish-pink
flowers that appear in May and June. Locusts sprout freely
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
from roots and form expanding thickets which encroach upon oak
clumps. They provide a valuable network of soil-holding roots,
important in retarding erosion. The best stands occur along the
east slopes of the Rincons.</p>
<p>Relatively few in number, compared with the stands of the
dominant ponderosa pine, the smaller <span class="small">CHIHUAHUA PINE</span> grows on
lower dry slopes and benches. Its needles are shorter than those
of the ponderosa pine, and its cones are conspicuously persistent,
remaining on the tree for several years. This Mexican species
invades the United States in the mountain ranges of southern
Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. In the monument it is
found mostly in the transition areas between oak-pine woodland
and ponderosa pine forest.</p>
<p>The Rincon Mountains are not high enough to provide a fir-forest
habitat except in a few favorable locations. On the highest
parts of the Rincons, ponderosa pines dominate in the warmer,
exposed locations, but whitebarked <span class="small">QUAKING ASPENS</span> grow in
pure stands on cooler slopes and with <span class="small">DOUGLAS-FIRS</span> on the north
side of Rincon Peak. West of Spud Rock are abundant small
groves of <span class="small">MEXICAN WHITE PINE</span>.</p>
<p>A cone-bearing tree growing with Douglas-fir&mdash;exclusively on
higher northern and northeastern slopes of Mica Mountain&mdash;is
the <span class="small">WHITE FIR</span>. Flattened, gray-green needles curving upward
from the branches, and large, green cones growing upright on
limbs near the tops of the trees identify this beautiful evergreen.
On open stands, limbs of even the large trees grow from the trunk
almost down to the ground. The bark is gray or ash-colored.</p>
<p><span class="small">BRACKEN</span> forms a green ground cover in heavy stands of pine
and fir. This fern grows 3 feet tall over much of the forested
Rincon highland. Among the shrubs found on the mountaintop
is the <span class="small">SNOWBERRY</span>, whose leaves are browsed by deer and whose
berries are eaten by birds and chipmunks.</p>
<p>A spring, a small mountain stream, and a meadow near Manning
Camp complete the picture of the higher elevations in the
monument. In this bit of meadowland are found <span class="small">BOXELDER</span>,
<span class="small">NEW MEXICAN ALDER</span>, <span class="small">CINQUEFOIL</span>, <span class="small">CHOKECHERRY</span>, <span class="small">GOLDENROD</span>,
<span class="small">ORANGE SNEEZEWEED</span>, <span class="small">MARIGOLD</span>, <span class="small">WILLOW</span>, and a number of
other shrubs, grasses, and herbs characteristic of the high mountain
meadows of the Southwest.</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">animals</span>
<br />and how they survive</h2>
<p>Just as plants depend for their existence on soil, water, and sunlight,
so animals, including man, depend on plants. For green
plants are the basic food producers in nature, manufacturing carbohydrates,
proteins, and other essential compounds from minerals,
air, and water, with the help of chlorophyll and the sun&rsquo;s
energy. Animals get their food either by eating green plants or
by eating animals that have eaten plants. Microscopic decomposers
complete this food chain, breaking down dead plants and
animals into substances that once again can be used by plants.
Since each link in the chain depends on the other links, it&rsquo;s not
hard to see that a change in one will cause a change in the others.
And because animals depend on plants for cover as well as for
food, their fortunes are doubly tied to the welfare of plants.</p>
<p>Animals and plants share some of the same basic problems&mdash;particularly,
how to stay within tolerable temperature limits, and
how to maintain an adequate supply of water. Plants solve these
problems mostly by structural adaptations, animals mostly by
behavioral. In the desert, for instance, cold-blooded animals
such as snakes and lizards (which have no internal control over
body temperature) crawl underground or into shade during the
midday heat of summer, and come out to hunt food during the
cooler hours. Birds and mammals cool themselves through evaporation
of water from their bodies. This makes water conservation
doubly critical for them; they too handle it by staying in the
shade or going underground during hot times. Desert animals get
much of their water from the plants and animals they eat, but some
species, such as mule deer and Gambel&rsquo;s quail, require large
amounts of drinking water as well.</p>
<p>Cold weather poses another problem. Most reptiles and some
mammals solve this one by hibernating underground or in rock
dens, where temperatures remain moderate throughout the year.
Many birds and some mammals migrate to areas where temperatures
are warmer and food is more abundant, which may mean
going farther south or simply moving down the mountainsides.
And insects can survive in a dormant form, as eggs or pupae,
though many species remain active during the temperate Sonoran
winters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>If you want to see animals, then, go where the vegetation is
thickest and most varied, and go when temperatures are moderate.
During warm seasons in the desert, this means that walking the
washes early or late in the day will give you the best chances for
seeing wildlife. Coveys of Gambel&rsquo;s quail explode into the air,
peccaries snort through the underbrush, butterflies festoon flowering
shrubs, and coyotes stealthily hunt.</p>
<h3 id="c18">Invertebrates</h3>
<p>Insects are generally not bothered by excessive heat, and many
species are active during the hottest hours. This is especially true
when the plant blossoming season is at its height. Flowers of
the mesquite, paloverde, catclaw, saguaro, and other desert plants
are &ldquo;alive&rdquo; all through the day, as many species of insects seek
nectar and pollen or prey on other insects attracted to the blossoms.
Insects are fed upon by various species of birds; flycatchers
flock to parts of the desert where nectar-yielding flowers are
numerous. Because of the absence of extreme cold, the desert
climate enables insects to be active throughout much of the year
and to support a considerable bird population.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig50">
<img src="images/i032.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="395" />
<p class="pcap">Despite its fearsome appearance and reputation, you have nothing
to fear from the tarantula.</p>
</div>
<p>Insects play a far more important role in the plant and animal
life of the desert than is usually realized. Many desert flowers
must be insect pollinated to produce viable seeds. Birds of many
kinds depend upon insects for food, and even the seed-eating birds,
during the nesting season, rely upon insects to provide the enormous
quantities of food and moisture required by their fast-growing
nestlings. Many other desert creatures, including certain
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
snakes and lizards and some spiders, depend upon insects for
food. The body juices of the insects provide the all-important
moisture&mdash;which these creatures can get from no other source.
Bats, too, are insect eaters, spending the hours of darkness in
seemingly aimless and erratic flight while foraging for moths and
other night-flying insects that visit the light-colored blossoms of
night-blooming plants.</p>
<p>Some species of insects may become so numerous that they
threaten the very life of the plants on which they live. Pine bark
beetles annually damage or kill numbers of pinyons and ponderosas
in the Rincon Mountains, but have been kept sufficiently under
control by their natural enemies so that their ravages have not
reached epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>Among the common spectacular insects is the <span class="small">TARANTULA
HAWK</span>, a large blue-black, red-winged wasp that preys on large
spiders. Temporarily paralyzing the spider with its sting, the wasp
lays a single egg on its victim, thereby assuring an abundance of
living food for its young. The <span class="small">PRAYING MANTIS</span> is another large
insect, usually green and inconspicuous among the foliage of
desert plants, which it frequents in search of small insects. Ants
of many species are active almost everywhere in the desert, harvesting
seeds of various plants. Some species construct mazes
of underground nest tunnels and deposit the excavated materials
on the surface, forming conical, sometimes, craterlike, anthills.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig51">

<p class="pcap">The small desert hairy scorpion is the only scorpion in the
monument that is dangerous to humans.</p>
</div>
<p>Along with the insects, other arthropods (jointed-leg creatures
with exoskeletons) find their home in the desert. The arachnids
(eight-legged arthropods) include spiders and scorpions. Of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
former, the <span class="small">NORTH AMERICAN TARANTULAS</span> are famous for their
large size and formidable appearance, which have given them the
wholly undeserved reputation of being dangerous to humans. The
really dangerous creatures are the <span class="small">SCORPIONS</span>, whose long, flexible
tails bear a poisonous stinger at the tip. Several species are
found in the monument; but only the small, straw-colored scorpion
has venom known to have been fatal to humans. The other
scorpions found in the area can inflict painful stings, but with
only localized and rarely serious effects.</p>

only by the giant toad of south Texas (and Mexico).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c19">Amphibians</h3>
<p>As might be expected, amphibians are scarce in the monument
because of lack of permanent water. The few springs and seeps,
however, furnish excellent breeding places for several species of
amphibians. Best known among these are the <span class="small">RED-SPOTTED TOAD</span>,
<span class="small">LEOPARD FROG</span>, and <span class="small">CANYON TREEFROG</span>, the latter common near
Manning Camp. A spectacular desert amphibian and the second
largest toad in the United States, is the huge <span class="small">COLORADO RIVER
TOAD</span>, sometimes found near residences in the evening when outdoor
lights attract swarms of insects.</p>
<h3 id="c20">Reptiles</h3>
<p>Except for small lizards, reptiles are not much in evidence in the
monument. Nevertheless, they are present and are important in
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
the various plant-and-animal communities in which they live.
Almost all lizards are insectivorous, and along with birds and other
insect-eaters help to keep the number of insects within bounds.
A notable exception is the <span class="small">GILA</span> (<span class="small">HEE</span>-lah) <span class="small">MONSTER</span>,
(See <a href="#c28">appendix</a> for scientific names of reptiles) largest of the lizards found
in the United States. (It is one of the world&rsquo;s two poisonous lizards,
and the only one found in this country.) The gila monster is
especially fond of bird eggs, and also eats nestlings and small
rodents, obtaining necessary moisture from their body juices.
These food habits are quite similar to those of the several species
of snakes found in the monument, the majority of which are perfectly
harmless to humans.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">

<p class="pcap">The short-horned lizard, more cold-tolerant than the desert horned
lizard, ranges from the foothills into the mountain forests of Saguaro.</p>
</div>
<p>Just as the lizards help to control the insect population, the
snakes are important in preventing the buildup of large numbers
of rodents that would result in widespread damage to vegetation.
Visitors to the monument rarely have the opportunity to observe
snakes, since they are in hibernation during winter and remain in
the shade or in underground burrows during the hot part of each
summer day. Perhaps those most frequently seen are the <span class="small">GOPHER
SNAKE</span> and the <span class="small">COACHWHIP</span>. Many desert snakes hunt only at
night; others that are normally active during days of moderate
temperatures become night hunters during hot weather. Although
they are not abundant, there are several kinds of rattlesnakes in
the monument, the commonest desert species being the <span class="small">WESTERN DIAMONDBACK</span>
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
and <span class="small">MOHAVE RATTLESNAKES</span>. Except for the small,
very rare, and secretive <span class="small">ARIZONA CORAL SNAKE</span>, rattlesnakes are
the only poisonous snakes in the monument. Snakes, like other
living things in the national monument, are protected by law.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised while following a desert footpath to come
upon a plodding tortoise. This bona fide desert dweller, the
<span class="small">DESERT TORTOISE</span>, is a vegetarian, feeding on cactus, grass, and
other low-growing plants.</p>
<h3 id="c21">Birds</h3>
<p>Because of its great variety of habitats, ranging from luxurious
desert vegetation to deep mountain forests, Saguaro National Monument
provides food and shelter for many species of birds. Some
of these reside all year within a single zone, while others move
upward in summer, returning to the desert when the mountaintops
are covered with snow. Other species pass through the monument
in spring and autumn in their annual migrations between Latin
America and summer nesting grounds in northern United States
or Canada. The following species are those you are most likely
to see.</p>

</div>
<p>A common year-round desert resident is the <span class="small">CURVE-BILLED
THRASHER</span>, noticeable, noisy, and about the size of a robin. These
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
energetic inhabitants of the cactus forests nest in mesquite clumps
and cholla thickets. Their diet&mdash;they feed on insects and succulent
fruits&mdash;makes them comparatively independent of water. The
thrashers are delightful songsters. The <span class="small">CACTUS WREN</span>, looking
somewhat like a small thrasher, is even noisier. It protects its
nest by building in a cactus. This wren lives largely on a diet of
insects, but about 17 percent of its food is seeds and fruits. One
of the most attractive of the ground birds is the <span class="small">GAMBEL&rsquo;S QUAIL</span>.
Many coveys are found throughout the desert within close range
of water. In winter, Gambel&rsquo;s quail feed mainly on seeds, berries,
and plant shoots; in summer they augment this diet with ants,
grasshoppers, and other insects. The <span class="small">ROADRUNNER</span>, ungainly
clown of the desert, is frequently seen by visitors as it scuttles
through the underbrush along the margins of sandy washes. Not
particular as to food, it is sometimes seen with the tail of a lizard
protruding from its beak, and it is known to eat insects and spiders,
snakes, young rodents, small birds, seeds, and fruits. Quite capable
of flight, the roadrunner prefers to trust to its legs and the security
of thickets, but will take to its wings if pursued in the open.</p>

<p>Two members of the woodpecker family closely associated with
the saguaro cactus are the <span class="small">GILA WOODPECKER</span> and <span class="small">GILDED FLICKER</span>.
Called carpenter birds because they drill nest holes or pockets in
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
the saguaro stems, both species are of particular interest because
of their limited range and specialized habitat. Two other desert
birds, sufficiently similar to be confused, are the red, black-faced
<span class="small">CARDINAL</span> and the gray-and-red <span class="small">PYRRHULOXIA</span>, both of which have
crests. Look for these species in the shrubs along washes. Several
kinds of doves are found in the desert, including the common
<span class="small">MOURNING DOVE</span> and the <span class="small">WHITE-WINGED DOVE</span>. Mourning doves
are all-year residents, while the large white-wings drift in from
Mexico in May, remaining long enough to raise families and join
other animals in harvesting fruits of the saguaro.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/i035.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="519" />
<p class="pcap">The gilded flicker drills its nest hole in the saguaro.</p>
</div>
<p>Seen and heard in the desert all year, the canary-voiced <span class="small">HOUSE
FINCH</span> raises its family among cholla and mesquite thickets. The
tinkling song of the <span class="small">ROCK WREN</span> is a familiar sound in the desert
in winter. These gray ground dwellers go farther north or to
higher elevations to nest.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">PHAINOPEPLA</span> is one of the most noticeable of the desert
birds because of its silky crest, glossy black plumage, and habit
of perching on the topmost branch of a tree while indulging in
flutelike song. A permanent resident of the monument, subsisting
on mistletoe berries and other vegetable matter in winter, it
has a diet of insects, principally ants, during the rest of the year.
Flycatchers are especially abundant and conspicuous during spring
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
and early summer when the blossoms of trees, shrubs, and the
larger cactuses attract swarms of insects. Among these birds are
<span class="small">SAY&rsquo;S PHOEBE</span> and <span class="small">ASH-THROATED FLYCATCHER</span>. The <span class="small">LESSER
NIGHTHAWK</span> lives on a diet of insects, which it catches while on
the wing. It is especially noticeable from May to September as
it skims the tops of the tallest saguaros in the dusk of evening.
The lesser nighthawk also ranges up to the oak woodlands.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/i035a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="518" />
<p class="pcap">The white-winged dove&rsquo;s interest in the saguaro is in the nectar and fruit.</p>
</div>
<p>Predators are an integral part of the bird population, one of
the smallest and most active being the <span class="small">LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE</span>. This
black-and-gray bird gorges itself on beetles and grasshoppers when
insects are abundant, turning to lizards, rodents, and small birds
at other times. It has the unusual habit of impaling its prey on
thorns for future use. The <span class="small">RED-TAILED HAWK</span> is the commonest
of the large soaring hawks, which live mainly on rodents and
reptiles. It builds its large stick nest in the forks of saguaro arms.
Like the shrike and the <span class="small">SPARROW HAWK</span>, the red-tailed hawk is
found in grasslands, chaparral, and woodlands as well as in the
desert. Because of their nocturnal habits, owls are not often seen
by visitors, but they are abundant in the monument. In addition
to the <span class="small">GREAT HORNED OWL</span>, which like the red-tailed hawk feeds
principally on rodents and builds cumbersome nests in saguaro
branches, the <span class="small">SCREECH OWL</span> and the tiny <span class="small">ELF OWL</span> are numerous
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
in the cactus community. Screech and elf owls make use of
abandoned woodpecker holes in saguaros, not so much for nesting
as for dark and comfortable hiding places during daylight
hours; they emerge after sunset to hunt insects and small rodents.
Best known of the carrion eaters, the <span class="small">TURKEY VULTURE</span> is rarely
seen on the ground, but is a common sight, singly or in groups,
circling high in the sky.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig58">
<img src="images/i036.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="597" />
<p class="pcap">The red-tailed hawk builds its nest in the fork of a saguaro and by
day ranges over the entire monument in search of prey.</p>
</div>
<p>The oak-pine-juniper woodland has its set of birds too. One
of the noisiest, most quarrelsome, and most mischievous is the
<span class="small">MEXICAN JAY</span>, a permanent resident. In summer, it shares this
habitat with the night-flying poor-will, which closely resembles
the nighthawk but lacks the white wing patches. Shy, secretive,
and protectively colored, this bird is rarely seen, but its plaintive
call is a familiar twilight sound at the middle elevations of the
mountains. Here, too, is found the strikingly patterned <span class="small">HARLEQUIN
QUAIL</span>, which waits until you are almost upon it before
flushing. The <i>RUFOUS-SIDED TOWHEE</i> prefers brushy slopes and
canyons, where it trills its monotonous song from the branch of
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
a skunkbush or scratches noisily and industriously among the
fallen leaves beneath an oak. And anywhere from the oak-pine
woodland to the top of the Rincons, you are likely to startle the
large <span class="small">BAND-TAILED PIGEON</span> from its perch.</p>
<p>The pine and fir forests of the higher Rincons are rich in bird
life in summer, but only a few species remain the year around.
Among the latter is the <span class="small">STELLER&rsquo;S JAY</span>, which includes insects in
its summer diet but feeds mainly on acorns and other vegetable
material in winter. The <span class="small">MOUNTAIN CHICKADEE</span> is busy among the
branches of the large pines and firs even when snow lies deep on
the ground. <span class="small">PIGMY NUTHATCHES</span>&mdash;tiny, constantly twittering insect-eaters&mdash;also
remain all year.</p>

</div>
<p>In summer, when insects are plentiful, the mountain forests are
alive with birds. The <span class="small">MEXICAN JUNCO</span>, which winters at lower
elevations, hides its nest in grass clumps among the firs and aspens.
Hummingbirds of several species pause on vibrating wings to suck
nectar from blossoms in the meadow at Manning Camp. Brightly
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
colored summer visitors such as the <span class="small">HEPATIC TANAGER</span> and the
<span class="small">PAINTED REDSTART</span> search for insects among the pine boughs or
flash in the sunlight as they flutter across open glades in the
forest. The mountaintops, too, have their predators; the <span class="small">COOPER&rsquo;S
HAWK</span>, which nests in wooded canyons, is large enough to lift a
pigeon or rabbit, but generally preys on rodents and smaller birds.
The largest bird known to inhabit the Rincon Mountains is the
<span class="small">TURKEY</span>, which nests and raises its young among the firs and
aspens. It descends in winter to the oak-pine woodlands, where
it feeds on pinyon nuts, acorns, and grass seeds.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Mammals</h3>
<p>The most frequently seen mammals in the monument are rodents
and members of the hare clan. Among the latter group are two
rabbits. The <span class="small">DESERT COTTONTAIL</span> is common in the lower levels
of the desert, and the <span class="small">EASTERN COTTONTAIL</span> inhabits the mountains
to 8,600 feet. Adaptable to a wide range of environmental conditions,
these animals augment the water they obtain from springs
with moisture derived from sap. There are two species of
<span class="small">JACKRABBITS</span> (actually hares) in the monument. They remain
at the lower levels, where they are a common sight amid the
cactuses. Unlike rabbits, which are born naked, blind, and
helpless, hares are born with fur, open eyes, and the ability to
move about.</p>

</div>
<p>Among the monument rodents the largest are the <span class="small">PORCUPINES</span>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
Though rarely seen, they leave characteristic scars on pinyons and
ponderosa pines, recording their feeding habits at higher elevations.
They are also active in the chaparral belt, and an individual occasionally
wanders down into the desert where it eats mesquite
beans and samples the bark of ocotillos and other shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Several species of ground squirrels are abundant. At the lower
levels, especially among creosotebushes, the <span class="small">ROUNDTAIL GROUND
SQUIRREL</span> finds suitable living conditions, while the <span class="small">YUMA ANTELOPE
GROUND SQUIRREL</span> ranges from the cactus forests into grassland.
At this elevation and upward through the pinyons and
junipers, the <span class="small">ROCK SQUIRREL</span> makes its burrows in rocky ledges and
brushy canyons. <span class="small">CLIFF CHIPMUNKS</span> enliven the oak-pine woodland
and higher forests with their quick movements and cheerful chatter.</p>
<p><span class="small">KANGAROO RATS</span> honeycomb the soil from the cactus forests up
to the oak-pine belt. Remaining underground during the day, they
are frequently seen at night. These animals do not require free
water; they obtain adequate moisture from a chemical process
within the body during the digestion of food, which is mostly dry
seeds. <span class="small">WOODRATS</span>, famous in song and story as pack rats or trade
rats because of their habit of carrying away objects of human
use and leaving something else in their place, are found throughout
the monument at all elevations. Look for their stick nests among
the pads of prickly pear, a favorite food.</p>
<p>Other rodents common in the monument include the <span class="small">CACTUS
MOUSE</span>, <span class="small">GRASSHOPPER MOUSE</span>, <span class="small">DEER MOUSE</span>, and <span class="small">VALLEY POCKET
GOPHER</span>.</p>

<p class="pcap">Mule deer.</p>
</div>
<p>Among the larger mammals in the monument are two species
of deer. The <span class="small">MULE DEER</span> subsists in winter on cactus fruits, ephemerals,
and other desert vegetation. In summer they find abundant
browse in the higher oak woodland. The forested areas along the
crest of the Rincons support a population of the smaller <span class="small">WHITETAIL
DEER</span>. These graceful animals browse on aspen, buckbrush,
and other shrubs and small trees. They are particularly fond of
acorns. When snow flies some descend to the protective cover of
the oak-pine woodlands and chaparral.</p>
<p><span class="small">PECCARIES</span>, characteristic of southwestern deserts, usually travel
in herds of from three to as many as 50 animals. They wander
through the groves of mesquite along desert washes, and root
among beds of pricklypear. Pricklypear pads are their chief
food; they are said to feed upon cactus fruits in summer and
autumn. In addition to the moisture obtained from succulent
stems and fruits, peccaries require considerable water, hence they
frequent springs and seeps. Small bands of these animals occasionally
visit the waterhole near the visitor center, where they
are excitedly watched by visitors fortunate enough to be in the
lobby at the time.</p>
<p>Saguaro National Monument also has a large number of predatory
animals. Many of these, popularly believed to be exclusively
meat-eaters, actually also eat much vegetable matter. The predators&mdash;an
exciting part of the monument&rsquo;s fauna&mdash;play an important
role in preventing overpopulation of the prolific rodents.</p>
<p>Chief among predators is the <span class="small">COYOTE</span>, which ranges throughout
the monument. In winter, coyotes are found principally below
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
6,000 feet, where hunting is easier and where rodents remain
longer out of hibernation. They are also known to roam the
forested heights of the Rincons and Tanque Verde Ridge. Studies
of coyotes in the monument made by biologist Lowell Sumner in
January 1951 showed that their winter diet consisted of about
78 percent fruits and seeds, 11 percent small rodents, 7 percent
deer, 4 percent birds, reptiles, insects, and carrion, and 1 percent
debris. The coyote is one of the principal wild creatures associated
with the history of the West, and its continuing presence
in the monument brings a thrill of pleasure to visitors who
hear the voices of the pack during the calm of evening, or
catch a glimpse of one of these gray canines trotting through
open stands of saguaros. <span class="small">BOBCATS</span>, ranging over much the same
territory as coyotes, subsist principally on rodents, birds, and
insects. Because of their secretive habits, they are seldom seen.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig65">
<img src="images/i038a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="412" />
<p class="pcap">Collared peccary, or javelina.</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="small">GRAY FOX</span> is another fairly common inhabitant of the
cactus desert and higher brushlands, and is also known to roam
the forested uplands. It is usually seen at night. Rodents are its
principal source of food, but it also preys on birds and reptiles
and eats much vegetable matter. The smaller and rather rare
<span class="small">KIT FOX</span>, restricted mostly to the desert, is also a night hunter.
Kangaroo rats are a favorite item in the kit fox diet, but these
small predators also eat grasshoppers and other insects.</p>
<p>Skunks, members of the weasel family, are relatively common
in the monument, and several species inhabit areas where water is
available. They are usually active at night. The <span class="small">HOGNOSE SKUNK</span>
is a desert dweller recognizable by its solid-white back. It roots
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
for insect larvae and eats cactus fruits, bird eggs, and nestlings.
The <span class="small">STRIPED SKUNK</span> ranges throughout the monument; the <span class="small">SPOTTED
SKUNK</span> is found at all elevations, usually among rocks. Insects,
rodents, and fruits are its main food.</p>
<p>Another member of the weasel family, the <span class="small">BADGER</span>, is occasionally
seen in the desert although it is by no means limited to
that habitat. The badger feeds mainly on rodents, which it digs
from burrows with its strong forelegs and heavy claws.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">RACCOON</span>, longer-legged than the badger, is readily recognized
by its gray fur, black mask, and ambling gait. It inhabits
brushy canyons having permanent water, and sometimes wanders
up into the pine belt in summer. Amphibians, scarce as they are,
and other water creatures are among the preferred foods of
raccoons; but they also eat small rodents and plant food, including
berries, acorns, and other fruits.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig66">
<img src="images/i039.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="438" />
<p class="pcap">Badger.</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="small">RINGTAIL</span>, a smaller relative of the raccoon, is somewhat
similar in habitat preference and nocturnal habits. Its flattened,
bushy tail, acting as a balancer, helps this short-legged, agile
animal in leaping from point to point on the steep rocky surfaces
it seems to favor. It sometimes takes up residence in little-used
or abandoned buildings, where small rodents, its principal
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
source of food, are usually abundant. About the size of a house
cat, it has large eyes and ears and alternating dark and light
bands on its tail.</p>
<p>A tropical animal that seems to be extending its range northward,
the <span class="small">COATI</span> (or coatimundi) is often seen in the forests of
the Rincons. With long snout and long, banded tail, it looks something
like an elongated raccoon, to which it too is related. These
omnivorous animals travel in bands, rooting among leaves for
insects and whatever else they can find.</p>

<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">the rhythms of nature</span></h2>
<p>Natural landscapes may appear unchanging, but this is illusion.
Within the apparent constancy, daily and seasonal cycles, fluctuations
in numbers, and long-term change are the rule.</p>
<p>Daily cycles are obvious to those who are about at the edges
of the day. Take 24 summer hours in the cactus forest of Saguaro
National Monument. When the first light comes over the mountains,
curve-billed thrashers and cactus wrens sing noisily among the
chollas. Other birds soon join in. The early morning walker is
likely to hear peccaries grunting in the mesquites along a wash,
or see mule deer staring at him, frozen like statues before sudden
flight to a sheltering thicket.</p>
<p>At midday, the scene is quiet. Nothing stirs under the baking
sun except perhaps a vulture, soaring on the hot air currents. The
desert creatures have not gone&mdash;they are in the shade of bushes
or underground. Even some of the plants are &ldquo;taking a siesta,&rdquo;
having folded their leaves or closed their leaf pores.</p>
<p>Soon after sundown the desert comes to life again. The birds
give a subdued version of their morning&rsquo;s vocal performance.
Tarantulas begin their slow, stately walk over the ground searching
for prey or mates. Coyotes stretch and howl&mdash;a prelude to the
evening&rsquo;s hunt. As night falls, rattlesnakes emerge from their cool
retreats to search out kangaroo rats, which in great numbers are
scrutinizing the sand for seeds. And through the night, creatures
of many other kinds hunt food to last them through another
broiling day.</p>
<p>The rhythmic patterns of the daily cycle are paralleled on a
larger scale through the year&mdash;seasons of activity follow seasons
of quiet. In the desert, rain or lack of rain marks the changes,
though gradually rising or falling temperature adds its impact.</p>
<p>The gentle rains of winter prepare the way for the year&rsquo;s greatest
burst of activity. By March, spring flowers are blooming and birds
are starting to nest. Snakes begin to come out of hibernation.
April and May see the apex of spring activity, as insects swarm
around the flowering plants, and birds take advantage of this
proliferation of food to raise their young. The desert now is
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
yellow with the blossoms of paloverde, mesquite, acacia, and
brittlebush.</p>
<p>But April also marks the beginning of a drought that intensifies
through May and June, making these last 2 months the year&rsquo;s
parching crucible in which reproductive ability is tested. If winter
rains have been meager, the heat and drought of May and June
can kill all the young of many birds. Some birds, such as Gambel&rsquo;s
quail, may not even attempt to nest in a dry year. Conditions
may be so harsh at this season that some mammals, such as the
pocket mouse, close up shop completely, sleeping the days away
underground.</p>
<p>Relief comes with the rains of July and August. Now the
summer annuals spring magically from the ground, perennials put
forth new leaves, and saguaros do all their growing for the year.
This summer burst of plant growth is accompanied by a new
hatching of insects, which allows a few more birds to nest, and
along with the new vegetation supports a larger pyramid of
animal life generally. Among the new animals that reappear are
toads, which now emerge from their long sleep in the soil to mate
and lay eggs in the pools formed by summer rains.</p>
<p>When the last torrential rain of August or September falls, a
new dip in the yearly cycle of activity begins. This one is not
so deep, not so trying, as the drought of early summer, but it
too is a time of relative quiet. Roundtail squirrels go underground
to sleep until cooler weather comes. Now the migrating birds
slip through, hardly noticed among the mesquites and paloverdes.
Butterflies lay their eggs, in preparation for a new generation
beyond the winter. Signaling the last phase in the yearly cycle,
wet canyons turn yellow and brown as cottonwoods, willows, and
sycamores present a pale version of the spectacular foliage displays
seen in the East.</p>
<p class="tb">While these daily and seasonal cycles are following their well-known
courses, each species of plant and animal is undergoing
its own fluctuations, in a constant struggle that generally goes
unnoticed. For the balance of nature is not a static one, but more
like the rocking of a seesaw on its fulcrum. The population of
a species goes up one year, down another&mdash;depending on the
weather, the food supply, predators, competitors, and a thousand
interactions that reverberate through the community in which it
lives. The numbers of some species, like the Gambel&rsquo;s quail,
fluctuate wildly from year to year, while those of others, such as
the harvester ant, remain quite stable. But the oscillations of the
seesaw, big and little, average out from year to year so that the
species maintains itself in the community. The other members
are going through the same thing, in a system of checks and
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
balances that over the short run keeps the whole community
nearly constant.</p>
<p>But over decades, centuries, or longer, the fulcrum of the
seesaw moves: the larger environment changes, and the community
and its constituent plants and animals must change with
it or perish. Such changes may be climatic, as we saw with the
formation of the Southwestern deserts; or it may be geologic, as
with the rising and partial disintegration of the Rincon Mountains.
The efforts of plant and animal species to meet such changes
constitute in large part the story of evolution, for new environments
spawn newly evolved forms of life. Evidence of such evolution
we have seen in the plants of the Sonoran Desert, notably
the giant saguaro cactus, whose prickly ancestor lived in the
West Indies only 20,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Thus nature is ever-changing; and the inexorable rule for all
living things is, &ldquo;adapt or perish.&rdquo; Before technological man
enters the scene, the slow evolutionary process can keep pace with
the changing environments, though here and there a species is
dropped by the wayside. Generally, communities of living things
reach new equilibria without serious disruption.</p>
<p>But what happens when man, with his machines and his passion
for progress, institutes changes of a speed and kind and on
a scale drastically different from those brought about by earthquakes,
storms, shifting climates, and other natural phenomena?
What happens to the living things that have adapted to the harsh
desert environment when that environment is drastically altered?</p>

<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">the impact of man</span></h2>
<p>Man has been a part of the scene in this region for several thousand
years, but until recent times his influence on it was minimal.
Only with the rapid technological development of the last century
has man been able to make a major impact on this landscape.
Thus the story of man, here as elsewhere, is a story of gradually
accelerating power to change environments, a power that now
threatens to destroy environments, and with them, man himself.</p>
<p>From carbon-14 dating in Ventana Cave, we know that man was
here at least 12,500 years ago, in the Pleistocene age, a time that
was cool and moist compared to the present. Living by hunting, he
followed mammoths and other large mammals. As the climate
warmed during succeeding millenniums, and these mammals became
extinct, he came to rely more on plant foods. These hunters
and gatherers necessarily had to live in small bands scattered over
the land, since the plants and animals on which they depended were
widely dispersed. By 300 B.C., they had learned from people to
the south how to cultivate food plants, and had developed a
sedentary way of life. About 2,300 years ago a group we call the
Hohokam settled in the Salt and Gila River basins (including the
Santa Cruz Valley). By A.D. 700 they had a well developed
agricultural economy including extensive irrigation systems. Pottery
fragments, projectile points, petroglyphs (rock carvings), and
other evidence show that Hohokam villages existed for about 600
years in the eastern section of the monument along Rincon Creek
and its tributary washes. Archeological work in the Tucson
Mountain Section has indicated that this area was visited only
temporarily by the Hohokam, for hunting, food gathering, and
perhaps ceremonial purposes.</p>
<p>During the 15th century the Hohokam high culture vanished.
Soils made salty from irrigation water and internecine warfare are
suggested explanations.</p>
<p>When the Spanish explorer Coronado passed to the east of the
Rincons in 1540, he found the Sobaipuri living there. The Pimas,
descendants of the Hohokam, occupied the same basins the Hohokam
had. To the west, in drier country, lived the Papago. These
tribes, thought to be descendants of the Hohokam, lived much
the same sort of life, practicing irrigation where surface water was
available, hunting and gathering where it was not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The period of Spanish rule, implemented by a series of missions,
began in the Santa Cruz Valley about 1692, when the
energetic Father Kino began his work among the Pima and
Papago. The mission system concentrated the Indians in fewer
places, brought Spanish and, later, Mexican settlers into southern
Arizona, and introduced sheep, cattle, and goats. Although the
new culture must have had some environmental effects, there is
no evidence of drastic change. Grass was plentiful, and streams,
including the Santa Cruz, remained marshy and unchanneled.</p>
<p>After the Gadsden Purchase of 1853-54, however, when the
present boundary with Mexico was established and this area came
into United States ownership, man&rsquo;s impact on the land increased.
Apache raiding had been a deterrent to settlement during the 18th
and 19th centuries, but, after the Civil War, American soldiers
got the upper hand and settlement increased. Following completion
of the Southern Pacific Railroad to Tucson in 1879, a cattle
boom began. The disastrous results of the livestock explosion
of the eighties&mdash;overgrazing, soil erosion, and starvation of cattle&mdash;we
have already seen in the story of the saguaro cactus. In 1890,
a flood cut a deep channel in the Santa Cruz River, transforming
it from a meandering, marshy stream to the usually dry incision
one sees today. The arroyo cutting of this and many other rivers
throughout the Southwest was undoubtedly due partly to increasing
aridity, which reduced the plant cover and its water-holding
capacity. But the erosion was probably triggered by overgrazing.</p>
<p>In the monument, we have already seen how grazing pressure,
hunting, and predator control reduced ground cover and led to
an upsurge of certain rodents and a decline in large mammals. But
there have been other man-induced changes. For as long as
there has been forest on top of the Rincons, there has been fire.
Lightning-caused fire is a natural part of ponderosa-pine forest,
every few years burning the litter and small trees and shrubs from
the forest floor, and thus maintaining open stands of tall trees.
But since 1908, when the Rincon Mountains came under protection
of the Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (to be
followed in 1933 by National Park Service, U.S. Department of
the Interior protection), fires have been put out as fast as possible.
This policy has resulted in a paradox. On the one hand,
thickets of scrawny young pines and shrubs such as buckbrush
have developed in many places under the tall pines. On the other
hand, the accumulation of litter and low-level vegetation has provided
fuel over the years for occasional very hot crown fires,
which have been hard to control and which have burned large
acreages. On top of the Rincons you can see several meadows
that resulted from these fires. Only a few scattered trees and
stumps remain in them to suggest the forest that once was there.</p>
<p>Ideally, national parks and monuments should be &ldquo;vignettes of
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
primitive America&rdquo;&mdash;naturally evolved landscapes in much the
same condition as when first seen by Europeans. In reality they
are compromises&mdash;beautiful, wild, but still bearing the marks of
human occupation. In Saguaro, as we have seen, fire control has
produced a forest different from that known to the Indians who
once lived here; grazing has depleted the ground cover; and hunting
has removed the desert bighorn from its rocky haunts. In these
days of burgeoning population, when human influence is affecting
every natural landscape, environmental management becomes necessary
to approach the ideal of naturalness. This may mean &ldquo;prescribed
burns&rdquo; to return forests to their earlier state; elimination
of grazing; or reintroduction of animals once native to a park. In
the summer of 1971, after 2 inches of rainfall, natural burns
(caused by lightning strikes) were allowed to run their courses.</p>
<p>Some or all of these measures may be taken in Saguaro, in
order that future generations will know a piece of the Sonoran
Desert as it was in Coronado&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>The realization of this goal, however diligently we work toward
it, seems almost each day to become more difficult of attainment.
These desert and mountain environments&mdash;which once seemed
secure, needing only the continued protection afforded by their
status as a national monument&mdash;are increasingly imperiled by the
works of man. As the city of Tucson sprawls in all directions, the
monument&rsquo;s two divisions, islands in an encroaching sea of civilization,
must withstand ever-accelerating hazards. Vandalism takes
an increasing toll of the saguaros; housing developments creep
toward the monument borders. Smog drifts over the fragile plant
communities, threatening to choke them&mdash;as the polluted air from
Los Angeles is already strangling forests in the distant San Bernardino
Mountains.</p>
<p>A new awareness that the best-managed preserve cannot thrive
independently of what is happening in the surrounding region
only emphasizes the difficulty of the task. Saving the saguaros
is inevitably tied to the problem of enhancing the quality of life
and reversing the degradation of the environment&mdash;not only in
Tucson but throughout the Southwest.</p>
<p>There is no time to waste. Only concerted effort by scientists,
resource managers, and the community can assure that our grandchildren
will be able to visit a Saguaro National Monument where
coyotes howl under the moon, peccaries snort through the washes,
and giant cactuses lift bristly green arms into a blue sky.</p>

<h3 id="c28">Reptiles and Amphibians of the monument.</h3>
<p>This checklist names reptiles and amphibians that have been seen,
or that should occur, according to range maps and distribution
records in important reference works, in the monument. Four of
these species are found only in the Tucson Mountain Section;
they are: desert iguana, desert horned lizard, western shovel-nosed
snake, and sidewinder. An asterisk marks those species most
commonly seen in the daytime.</p>
<p>The <i>desert</i> (D) habitat is the rather flat or gently rolling terrain
below 3,200 feet in elevation, as seen in the vicinity of the
visitor center and the Cactus Forest Drive, and in the north and
west portions of the Tucson Mountain Section.</p>
<p>The <i>foothills</i> (F) habitat includes the area above 3,200 feet
where the land becomes quite rocky and begins to ascend rather
sharply on the Cactus Forest Drive and along Hohokam Road in
the Tucson Mountain Section.</p>
<p>The <i>mountain</i> (M) habitat is restricted to the Rincon Mountains
above an elevation of 6,500 feet where one finds tall trees.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
